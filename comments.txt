There is NO harm in fact Glyphosate is even much much safer than many of the highly toxic pesticides Organic growers use Jay.

Your post is garbage. Glyphosate is a herbicide that is NOT consumed by humans. The highly toxic pesticides Organic growers use are consumed and many of them are much much more toxic Can you even name the crops that can have Glyphosate used on them? When is it used? How much is used? I think we will find out that your knowledge on this subject is ZERO [USER 0 NAME].

Thank You for showing more of Your ignorance on this subject [USER 0 NAME]. Monsanto was bought 4 years ago and does NOT exist. There are many companies even foreign companies producing and selling Gylphosate(Roundup) What year did Glyphosate come on to the market for farmers to use ? Your knowledge on this subject is ZERO [USER 0 NAME].

Yes your ignorance is outstanding [USER 0 NAME]!!! The IARC which a division of the World Health Organization which is what you are talking about said in March of 2015 that Glyphosate was probably a carcinogenic. They also said that beer, coffee, cell phones, aloe vera, pickled vegetables, fried chicken, and sunlight were also probably carcinogenic. They agreed that Glyphosate is the safest herbicides that farmers have ever used. In fact the LD 50 number which is the ratings used all the world to measure toxicity with the HIGHER the number the LOWER the toxicity. To show how low a toxicity Glyphosate has here are some examples. Nicotine 9 caffeine 192 Tylenol 338 Codeine 427 2-4-D 665 OFF for mosquitoes 1014 Table salt 3000 Vinegar 3300 Baking Soda 4220 Roundup(Glyphosate) 5600.
Out of many many many herbicides that farmers can use on gmo crops GLYPHOSATE is by far the SAFEST of them ALL. Can you name one herbicide that is safer than GLYPHOSATE? Glyphosate is even safer than many of the pesticides that Organic growers use. Glyphosate is applied at specific rate and no more just like all the other herbicides that Farmers use.

Starving due to failed crops goes way beyond weird. All plants are constantly waging chemical warfare with the plants they compete with, this happens out of sight in the soil between competing roots. Many of our favorite foods are actually pesticides, like hot peppers. The smell of freshly mowed grass is a chemical repellent to grazing animals that nature gave to grass. You have a lot to learn and it takes time. Farm chemicals are put ON crops, not IN the harvested foods from those crops.

No rebranding. Just new ownership of the patents and existing brand names by Bayer as the old Monsanto corporation was completely dissolved. All Monsanto CEOs were fired, all Monsanto workers laid off, all Monsanto facilities shut down. The only thing left of Monsanto is a file cabinet with old patents and brand registrations in the German Bayer AG office. Nothing more. Stop making up conspiracy theories. You no longer have the Monsanto bogeyman, as much as the organic thugs needed it to make you think modern farming is evil. The organic woo frauds are the proven, documented and peer reviewed evil today. This channel made a video about the organic foods hoax.

What a hateful lie! Nobody "forces" us to by any particular foods. It is absolutely totally true and factual that every food is tested in the US. GMOs are the most tested of any foods, it takes an average of 13 years to get a new seed approved. Organic foods are never tested at all. BILLIONS OF PEOPLE ARE STARVING!!! Developing countries in Asia and Africa are now making their own GMO seed using their own scientists, this fact destroys your toxic claims. You have no way to help their crops survive better in droughts and floods but crop modern crop science can.

Let me tell you who the 'colonialists' who foil modern crop science in Africa really are and where they come from. They are European anti-biotech activists and EU organic industry operatives who were sent to Africa to spread disinformation to your people. They know that if Africa employs modern crop science their strangle hold on high priced organic foods in the EU will lose because Africa will undersell them severely in price. I see very dishonest Youtube videos posted by Africans who were put up to it and manipulated by organic farming liars from other countries. They tell you GMOs are dangerous or even poison which is a total lie.

Globalist? GMOs were only grown in the USA for the first 20 years. When scientists around the world were amazed by our bounty they got interestd and decided on their own to make their own GMO seeds. There is only one 'global' GMO, the life saving GMO Golden Rice which is protected from profiteering with a humanitarian patent. That was global from inception, declared essential by humanitarinas around the world to feed the malnourished in many countries.

Absolutely false! We have been breeding plants for over 10,000 years. While that still qualifies as sudden during 3 billion years of history, it is 40 years since the first GMO insulin. Over a full human generation and still mo evidence of harm from modern crop science. Breeding methods have always been improving. GMO is already going obsolete due to the precision gene editing of CRISPR science but GMOs are the only crops tested for years before aproval. All other crops and plants have been tested by simply eating them to see what happens.
GMOs are one of the most highly studied sopics in science with over 11,000 peer reviewed studies and articles. This fact exposes your lie about that. Genetic engineers can never offer any seed for sale that has not been fully investigated by the FDA in advance. Trials happen BEFORE release, same with vaccines. In 30 years there has never been a single proven health risk with GMO crop science while it actually reduces the use of toxic pesticides by 37%, increasing the health of the average farmer. KZGT did provde peer reviewed science citations at the bottom of the video description if you expand it down.

Educated people who respect science never try to inject our own opinions, feelings or hunches. We know the experts have all the best information. The first rule of science that all grade school kids are taught is that only what is studied, proven, verified and peer reviewed is a fact. This attack is your folly born of a poor education. You continue to make a fool of yourself in a venue used by 12 million children.

You are confused. The crop pests that BT kills have no dominant place in nature where they are in very small numbers. Farms are an unnatural environment created by humans that provide a concentrated area of food for the borer worms. It is humans who created the imbalance so any control of pests brings their numbers closer to their normal existence in nature. There are no wild fields of corn or soy for pests to feed on. We know what they do in the wild but they are in small numbers there, kept in balance by natural forces.

False. Monsanto shut down 4 years ago. No science studies have ever found a connection to cancers so our supreme court ruled there is no basis for lawsuits. Bayer AG decided to do a single $2 billion settlement for all 40,000 fake lawsuits pushed by crooked lawyers who advertised on late night TV for people who wanted to cash in on their hustle. The very first lawsuit that tried to get $220 million for one man was never paid. The claimants will get very little each after the lawyers take their cut.

That is stupid and illogical. No relevance here. He exaggerated too. Farmers must intentionally choose high performance patented seeds and sign a contract before they can buy them. Farmers know in advance that they will not be replanting their seeds and in fact, seed saving has fallen out of favor. It is a lot of work. Also, hybrid seeds are very popular and no farmers will replant hybrids because that always results in lower performance when replanted whether it is conventional or GMO hybrid seed. You are poorly educated and posting hateful lies.

"Natural" is a fallacy capitalized on by the propagandists of the organic foods cartel. Soon the FDA is going to ban the word natural from all food labels. We have been 'messing' with genes for over 10,000 years - not one single plant or animal we farm is as it was 10,000 years ago when we started. No particular breeding method is more 'evil' than others. GMO science is already on the way out, CRISPR gene editing is taking over. There will be something else after that. You can not prove any lies are in the video. 9.4 million views tells us how much this carton is relied upon by teachers who assign it to students.

He also played that idiotic shill card, an automatic forfeit here. Playing the shill gambit is always a forfeit of the debate at hand. It is a pathetic form of cheating by trying to poison the well rather than countering with a cogent refutation that might prove your point or win a debate. I see lameoids pull this stupid blunder 10 times a day in the GMO debate. If you want to prove a fault in science, use the tools scientists use, peer reviewed studies and unbiased information sources. If you don't have solid evidence, consider what a fool you are being. Shill shill shill just makes you look like a blathering idiot and forfeits every time, the win goes to science truth. The shill gambit failed debating tactic is explained simply in the dictionary of your choice. This is especially ludicrous when you consider the GMO safety debate ended four years ago and no company for profit anywhere would spend a single penny paying a "shill" to promote something already attained in 2016 with release of that landmark NAS study.

Only zucchini and Hawaiian papayas are GMO sourced. 93% of all GMO grown in the US is used for cattle feed and ethanol fuels. Sweeteners and oils made from GMO crops are not legally described as GMO because refining removes all traces of DNA and stray proteins. Organic sourced refined sweeteners and oils are chemically identical to GMO sourced versions. GMO is a breeding method only and not an actual ingredient.

The only true fact Depardieu posted was about n=how many people are hungry every day - but then he made up total fantasy about why.
MONSANTO NEVER SOLD A SINGLE BITE OF FOOD TO CONSUMERS!!!!
Monsanto only provided the exact seed farmers asked for. Farmers are smart, not naive fools like this lying troll wants you to believe. Farmers only buy what they value and nothing more. Monsanto was not a 'green revolution company', that ended decades ago! "The 'Green Revolution' is a set of research technology transfer initiatives occurring between 1950 and the late 1960s, that increased agricultural production worldwide, beginning most markedly in the late 1960s."

Depardieu also lied about yield as the basis for developing GMO crops. False. Yields are not much larger in cases where good conditions exist but when common challenges to farming like flood, drought, pest attacks, temperature extremes or salty soils exist the GMO crops still give great yields when other methods fail. This irks organic farmers to no end!

False. The USDA organic standard only requires a 25 foot buffer from GMO crops. There are no wild stands of corn, soy or alfalfa so that is not an issue either. Each year farmers plant a fresh crop. The majority of farmers no longer save and replant their seed so there is no [USER 79] for a change in traits. In all cases, natural selection has never stopped working outside of farms.

You are caught in an ignorant lie. The Flavr Savr was the ONLY GMO tomato to ever be marketed. No others are GMO, period. The old one was meant to survive freeze damage but it did not achieve that particularly well and the brand owner was not a skilled businessman so that brand went obsolete 15 years ago. Gone, just like Monsanto has been gone for 3 years now. I invite all readers seeing this to go to Wikipedia and look up GMO tomato to see I am 100% correct and Moose is wrong. Only zucchini, yellow squash and Hawaiian papayas are GMOs sold in fresh markets. The new GMO non-browning apple is just used for sliced snack packs because it needs no preservatives to prevent browning. Otherwise it is identical in flavor and nutrition, it can not be identified in blind taste tests.

There are none sold today but there is a plan for some in Israel, not intended for export at this time. Breeders have hundreds of varieties of tomato seeds to choose from. We would do GMO versions to achieve a specific goal that would take too long or be too hard to do with conventional breeding. There is no GMO citrus fruit either. Seedless is not GMO. It simply is not as widely used as Youtube conspiratards claim. They see an extra large strawberry, banana or some fruit with more or fewer seeds and decide to post a video calling it GMO with no proof at all. My motto is "No proof? Never happened!".

They are getting it - if it is not already being distributed it is in the works.

It's called fear mongering and the organic thugs tried to make labeling of breeding methods even more dishonest to slant sales towards their crappy over priced products. Obama put a stop to it.

Bt gmo technology is now being use in Europe as in all over the world. Organic growers have used Bt for decades even injecting some food with Bt. I am sure you have heard of Bt corn. Bt corn contains naturally occurring Bacillus thuringiensis bacteria, a result of recombinant DNA techniques. that selectively kill caterpillar pest. Organic growers have for decades approved sprays containing Bt, a naturally occurring soil bacterium. Bt produces biotoxins lethal to moths,caterpillars and butterflies when ingested. Because it targets these insects' intestinal membranes(ABSENT in HUMANS and ANIMALS ), the EPA considers it benign to non- caterpillar species, including beneficial insects. When Organic growers spray Bt they kill all moths,caterpillars, and butterflies but we do not do that with gmo corn because only corn bore and corn rootworms attacks corn so they are the only insects affected. For 80 years farmers like me used dangerous dangerous pesticides to control theses insects but today we do not have to use them thanks to gmo technology. GMO technology is safer for my children, my Wife, our water, our farm, and our environment. WE and YOU should give thanks to almighty GOD for the wisdom of GMO Technology.

Organic growers have for decades approved sprays containing Bt, a naturally occurring soil bacterium. Bt produces biotoxins lethal to moths,caterpillars and butterflies when ingested. Because it targets these insects' intestinal membranes(ABSENT in HUMANS and ANIMALS ), the EPA considers it benign to non- caterpillar species, including beneficial insects. When Organic growers spray Bt they kill all moths,caterpillars, and butterflies but we do not do that with gmo corn because only corn bore and corn rootworms attacks corn so they are the only insects affected. For 80 years farmers like me used dangerous dangerous pesticides to control theses insects but today we do not have to use them thanks to gmo technology. GMO technology is safer for my children, my Wife, our water, our farm, and our environment. WE and YOU should give thanks to almighty GOD for the wisdom of GMO Technology.

David is right. You are an idiot posting totally unproven illogical lies. There has never been a "chain reaction" of any kind in nature unless it was because we caused an extinction - you were supposed to learn about natural selection and survival of the fittest in grade school. Instead you were busy smoking dope and skipping classes. No chain reactions come from farming unless it is practiced incorrectly, like cutting down forests to farm Amazon land. One of the thousands of facts you avoided learning is that seedless fruits are NOT GMOs. All farming of every type is invasive to nature - no exceptions. The only thing you can do to increase balance is to never reproduce.

Lies!!! Nasty organic farming activists convinced you of that. It is false. Glyphosate is the least toxic herbicide ever formulated, it is 43% less toxic to humans than table salt. All other pesticides we used before are FAR MORE TOXIC by a factor of hund[USER 86]s. There are no side effects of any kind to humans from glyphosate, that is another activist lie with no legitimate science studies to back it up. Those liars also fooled you about the reason why farmers do not want to replant seeds - hybrid seed is never replanted because it loses its desi[USER 86] traits, even if it is organic or conventional or heirloom hybrid. GMOs
DO NOT
require specific fertilizers - a farmer can choose to use manure instead if he want to, stop making up lies to make our farmers look stupid. Only a fraction of GMO seed is meant to go with glyphosate and nothing bad happens if you plant glyphosate tolerant GMO seed without using the glyphosate, there are other ways to control weeds but they are all much more expensive and time consuming. Farmers know what they are doing, you are clueless. Indian farmers literally rioted in their streets last year, demanding access to better GMO seed! Monsanto shut down 3 years ago, it is gone. Organic is a scam, they use even more pesticides. Look at the USDA organic standards website. You will be shocked by what you find and your face will turn [USER 86] as you realize what a blunder you made here. Stick with playing the guitar.

That is pathetic. It only proves Greenpeace meddled there and poisoned the MINDS of simple farmers. Rice is not a GMO and is not glyphosate tolerant. The new GMO golden rice is also not made to be compatible with any particular pesticide and it has not gone into wide spread use yet but it is fully approved. Philippines is currently crossing GR with local strains of the preferred rice. More likely, you are simply lying. Pesticides are never used for no reason and they sure as fuck would never be used if yields were higher without them, that makes no sense at all! Most GMO rice is for surviving floods or droughts or salty marshes. The newest one will be able to be grown in sea water. Fertilizers always improve yields, no exceptions unless they were incorrectly used.

6) Almost posted a deceiving statement about the largest most expert study on GMO crops in all history. It changed everything, ending the GMO safety debate. What he left out is that when there is bad weather, soil issues or pests, GMOs do much better by continuing to provide a good yield under bad conditions. The NAS also said that GMO is no more or less impactful on the environment compared to other farming methods, a great virtue for seed that is superior without doing damage. Since that 2016 study more and more new studies find that in fact, organic agriculture is much less productive per acre, making it bad for climate change mitigation. To grow all our food organically would require cutting down all forested parks in the US.

"bruh" without capitalization at the start of a sentence indicates you are a poorly educated loser. If you paid attention in grade school you would know that humans have been breeding all foods we eat for maximum advantage for over 10,000 years. If we had not we would have no cauliflower, broccoli, kale, turnips, Brussels sprouts, cabbage and many other vegetables all with that one common humble ancestor, the wild mustard plant. Carrots would still be 2 inch long bitter white roots. We would have no corn. Apples would still be tiny sour things the size of a grape. What we do is the exact opposite of 'screwing up' you ignorant fool. Stop insulting our honest hard working farmers and crop scientists who toil to feed your ungrateful ass.

The largest GMO safety study in all history was done by the most highly qualified science panel on Earth in 2016 - our National Academy of Sciences. This landmark study ended the GMO safety debate forever as it became settled science. It was so conclusive and factual it prompted Obama to sign the new GMO labeling law in 2016, that law is in full effect now in 2020. The study found that on average, all factors considered, GMO crop science is no more or less impactful on human health and the environment than any other farming methods including organic and is superior in many beneficial ways.

Farmers buy any kind of seed they want. The fact that farmers rush to buy premium high performance GMO seed should tell you something. They willingly sign a contract with the seed purchase that says they may not replant patented seed. Most ignorant trolls do not know that hybrid seed is never replanted regardless, whether it is patented organic hybrid, un-patented conventional or patented GMO hybrid seed, it will not perform as well when replanted. This is the main reason farmers do not save and replant their seed. Now in 2020 there are many GMO seeds with expired 20 year old patents. They become a bargain for farmers and a gift to humanity. Every GMO seed today will eventually see its patent expire!

6) Almost posted a deceiving statement about the largest most expert study on GMO crops in all history. It changed everything, ending the GMO safety debate. What he left out is that when there is bad weather, soil issues or pests, GMOs do much better by continuing to provide a good yield under bad conditions. The NAS also said that GMO is no more or less impactful on the environment compared to other farming methods, a great virtue for seed that is superior without doing damage. Since that 2016 study more and more new studies find that in fact, organic agriculture is much less productive per acre, making it bad for climate change mitigation. To grow all our food organically would require cutting down all forested parks in the US.

That is absolutely false and impossible to prove because every harvest is different - different weather, different soils, different seeds and care. To even BEGIN to do a fair honest comparison you would have to have organic, conventional and GMO versions grown on the same farm in the same weather, and then all picked at the IDENTICAL TIME IN TERMS OF RIPENESS AND HANDLED IDENTICALLY until the moment you have the [USER 79] to smell and taste them. You know full well that the larger the farm and supplier is, the more of a delay there is between harvest and the store display. That only makes freshly picked organic produce, picked at peak ripeness, smell and taste better at great cost to your budget and food waste compared to mass produced produce shipped and stored longer but far more economically. Mass production reduces waste by picking early and shipping refrigerated. Mass produced organic produce is identical in taste and nutrition to mass produced foods using other breeding and farming methods but you pay a huge amount for the woo and the propaganda of organic. How much more? $3 billion a year!!!
Organic industry tyranny for 32 years and counting:
"Although GMOs are regarded as safe as their conventional counterparts by every major food safety authority in the world, the organic industry spends nearly $3 billion a year through over 330 different organizations leading with fear and “information spin” as an industry to sell their products. By creating an unfounded fear that requires tighter regulations on GMO crops, they are hoping to force them out of the food supply, thereby creating a bigger market share to sell more products in their more than $65 billion wheelhouse.
The unfortunate consequence of these [non-GMO] labels is that the food companies and lobbyists tend to create an unnecessary “us vs. them” divide. When food companies use fear against competitors to sell a product, farmers take it personally."
https://www . agdaily . com/insights/farm-babe-label-trends-end/
Now why do you suppose organic food is so expensive?? Imagine what 3 billion dollars could do for humanitarian goals - end a different disease forever every year.... End all hunger in at least one country...... Funding nasty propaganda? Really??

Yes there was MUCH wrong, and then we made everything twice as bad with climate change factors that make it even worse. A corn fungal toxin was killing thousands of people before we stopped it with GMO seed that conventional breeding could not control. The Bt trait, INVOLVING NO 'TOXIC CHEMICALS' has freed farmers from the use of toxic pesticides by repelling the borer worm pests which can quickly destroy an entire crop. GMO crop science saved the Hawaiian papaya industry from extinction. GMO apples, INVOLVING NO 'TOXIC CHEMICALS', do not brown so there is less waste and sliced snack packs need no chemical treatments. GMO rice, potatoes, bananas and cassava, INVOLVING NO 'TOXIC CHEMICALS' will stop 300,000 cases of blindness every year due to vit A shortage. GMO elm trees can bring back the American ELM. GMO eggplant, INVOLVING NO 'TOXIC CHEMICALS', developed by Bangladesh scientists and given free to the poorest farmers on Earth, has increased the income of those farmers six fold while ending their exposure to pesticide sprays. New salt resistant crops will do better in salty soils, INVOLVING NO 'TOXIC CHEMICALS'. New drought and flood and temperature extreme seed will help farmers to deal with climate change challenges, INVOLVING NO 'TOXIC CHEMICALS!!' And all I just listed is only a fraction of the constant improvements. So fuck off, asshole. Learn about a topic before you attack it.

All those things already exist. All but fresh produce has a long shelf life and it is far longer then the 'best by' or 'use by' dates. There are suppliers of long term food storage supplies and canned goods already last 2 years or more. Waste is with fresh produce. A small can of tomato paste has the same nutrition as a big pile of fresh tomatoes and many vegetables can be dehydrated for storage. None of that will stop the primary cause of wasted food. We already have local farm markets and now are expanding the use of local indoor hydroponics farming. The smartest thing you can do to preserve land and stop inefficient farming is to never buy organic foods. Other methods get far more from each acre.

Off topic. GMO crops are not poisonous to humans. The Bt trait can kill borer worm pests but it has no effect on any other living thing and it lets farmers avoid using toxic pesticide sprays.

There is far too much corruption in South America. Most issues with farming there turn out to be counterfeit pesticides, labels on pesticides that are in the wrong language or being used by illiterate farmers and farmers not using proper personal protection gear. Plantation owners let their workers get soaked in pesticides, they then go home to their family and contaminate everything. Your challenge of corruption is almost insurmountable.

What a stupid thing to say! Monsanto shut down 3 years ago. There are many biotech companies. None would 'sponsor' KZT which covers a rainbow of topics. You really screwed yourself with that shill card. Playing the shill gambit is always a forfeit of the debate at hand. It is a pathetic form of cheating by trying to poison the well rather than countering with a cogent refutation that might prove your point or win a debate. I see lameoids pull this stupid blunder 10 times a day in the GMO debate. If you want to prove a fault in science, use the tools scientists use, peer reviewed studies and unbiased information sources. If you don't have solid evidence, consider what a fool you are being. Shill shill shill just makes you look like a blathering idiot and forfeits every time, the win goes to science truth. The shill gambit failed debating tactic is explained simply in the dictionary of your choice. This is especially ludicrous when you consider the GMO safety debate ended two full years ago and no company for profit anywhere would spend a single penny paying a "shill" to promote something already attained in 2016 with release of that landmark NAS study.

Bt gmo technology is now being use in Europe as in all over the world. Organic growers have used Bt for decades even injecting some food with Bt. I am sure you have heard of Bt corn. Bt corn contains naturally occurring Bacillus thuringiensis bacteria, a result of recombinant DNA techniques. that selectively kill caterpillar pest. Organic growers have for decades approved sprays containing Bt, a naturally occurring soil bacterium. Bt produces biotoxins lethal to moths,caterpillars and butterflies when ingested. Because it targets these insects' intestinal membranes(ABSENT in HUMANS and ANIMALS ), the EPA considers it benign to non- caterpillar species, including beneficial insects. When Organic growers spray Bt they kill all moths,caterpillars, and butterflies but we do not do that with gmo corn because only corn bore and corn rootworms attacks corn so they are the only insects affected. For 80 years farmers like me used dangerous dangerous pesticides to control theses insects but today we do not have to use them thanks to gmo technology. GMO technology is safer for my children, my Wife, our water, our farm, and our environment. WE and YOU should give thanks to almighty GOD for the wisdom of GMO Technology.

No negative health effect of any kind has been detected after 30 years of GMO consumption. When we eat something bad we know from between 5 minutes and 4 hours. What the fuck is that reference to addiction? You are nuts!! The companies that produce GMO seed DO NOT GROW IT, farmers grow it and farmers are wise and loyal to the people they feed. It is most definitely enough to say the "pasticite" [pesticide] in them is harmless to humans. This exact same pesticide, which is actually a protein molecule, in found as a common soil bacteria. It can only affect a few species of borer worm pests, and no other living thing! Organic farmers have been using the Bt toxin for 40 years. Why don't you falsely attack them as well, based on no evidence? The topic of GMO safety is one of the most heavily researched topics with over 10,000 peer reviewed studies.

No. Nobody can forget what never happened. All seeds ever used in the last 100 years are preserved in seed banks and vaults and on hobby farms. Nothing is ever lost, new high performance seed just adds to the existing choices. Farmers choose what works best for them. They have no interest in seeing older seeds go permanently extinct, we need them for breeding projects. Please do not repeat conspiracy theories fabricated by organic foods lobbyists. GMO specialty seeds for staple crops are not used much by small scale farmers.

You are not aware. like all farmers are aware, that hybrid seeds never work well when replanted. This is true for all hybrids, even organic. They lose their desired traits when the seed is saved so farmers don't want to replant them, They know the higher cost of patented seeds offers a bargain in performance and their profits. In addition, no sterile terminator seeds have ever been sold - that is a myth. Terminator seeds only existed in laboratories but lying activists and organic goons want you to think they exist as an evil. All GMO seeds absolutely benefit everyone involved in every way. They definitely benefit agriculture, otherwise there would be no market for them. Farmers asked for better seed and they got it. All seed patents expire after 20 years, there are already many expired patent high performance seeds that are a low priced bargain now but even at full price they have to offer advantages or no one would buy them. GMO corn seed has dropped $100 a bag in price when its patent expired. It is selling [USER 109] now with those who think the newer versions of GMO corn may not be worth the premium. But it all sells year after year due to demands, not because any arms are twisted.

There are NO terminator seeds used in gmo technology crops. GMO technology crops are regulated. GMO technology is only used when it offers a tremendous benefits for farmers wanting to use gmo technology seed. If there is no benefit to using gmo technology seed you will not get farmers to spend the extra money for the seed.

Your post is False. Organic Growers use many toxic pesticides that more toxic than anything used on GMO technology crops. No need for organic foods to be labelled to tell you when they are breed with radiation induced mutagenesis, 2400 organic crops owe their origin to Mutagenesis.

Almost all insulin used by diabetics today is made from Genetically Modified cells(gmo). Before genetic engineering(gmo), diabetics injected insulin extracted from pig and cow pancreases. Some diabetics had allergic reactions to insulin from animal pancreatic tissue. Through genetic engineering(gmo), the insulin gene from humans is inserted into bacteria. The bacteria act as miniature(gmo) factories pumping out an insulin protein identical to human insulin. This insulin is then purified and used for human medical purposes. Organic Certification does not equal [USER 112] presence of a gmo. Low level presence of a gmo in Organic production is allowed as long as the grower has followed the organic process for organic production. Organic crops with gmo presence can and are sold as Organic. The USDA certification does not have a [USER 112] policy

It is a pathetic form of cheating by trying to poison the well rather than countering with a cogent refutation that might prove your point or win a debate. I see lameoids pull this stupid blunder 10 times a day in the GMO debate. If you want to prove a fault in science, use the tools scientists use, peer reviewed studies and unbiased information sources. If you don't have solid evidence, consider what a fool you are being. Shill shill shill just makes you look like a blathering idiot and forfeits every time, the win goes to science truth. The shill gambit failed debating tactic is explained simply in the dictionary of your choice. This is especially ludicrous when you consider the GMO safety debate ended two full years ago and no company for profit anywhere would spend a single penny paying a "shill" to promote something already attained in 2016 with release of that landmark NAS study.

Since drugs are altering something in humans, it's important to know the side-effects that they may cause and whether or not they're causing the anticipated effect (i.e. is it better than placebo). In contrast, GMOs are designed to be equivalent to their non-GE counterparts: they aren't drugs or nutritional supplements." geneticliteracyproject[dot]org/2016/01/13/ no-long-term-gmo -studies-humans/

5) The fact that the ISAA lists GMO crops separately is totally benign and has no negative connotations whatsoever! This moron thinks it means something. It does not, nor does the ISAA imply there are any additional risks with GMO foods. It endorses the high value of GMO crop science.

6) False premise!! GMO seed is not sold primarily to increase yields, it is to reduce risks from pests and extreme conditions while using less pesticides. Yields are far more stable since farmers don't have to worry about many of the usual issues that can DROP yields, investing in GMO seed is a form of crop insurance with a guaranteed benefit. When you use little to no pesticides at all, your FINANCIAL YIELDS are far greater in the form of profits! Same bushels per acre, more profits.

Calling all KZGT subscribers and readers - note I will increase my daily calling out of invasive hate trolls until this stops. KZGT fans and science respecting educated adults who hate trolls and malicious liars - Join me in reporting the anti-science GMO hater troll '[USER 24]' who is in fact mentally ill. Let's not allow hater trolls and malicious liar stalkers to take over this venue. Whether they are Russian spammers, Greenpeace activists or organic industry operatives the result is the same. If you sort for newest and scroll down you will see just how bad this infection is. We welcome debate but not liars with ulterior motives that insult the integrity of our hard working farmers and scientists. Flag him for spam or cyber bullying and report his channel because the shitty, practically non-existent moderation scheme in G+ has no specific button for reporting stalkers or malicious trolls. KZGT works on your behalf to post the truth, don't let trolls get away with trying to discredit the effort. To report these trolls, click on their channels, locate the flag button and report them for cyber bullying or spam or both. Copy this page's address into the complaint form and click it.

Every day this IDIOT NUT JOB 'Almost' fully forfeits the debate and hands victory to us because he tries to pull that shill card. Playing the shill gambit is always a forfeit of the debate at hand. It is a pathetic form of cheating by trying to poison the well rather than countering with a cogent refutation that might prove your point or win a debate. I see lameoids pull this stupid blunder 10 times a day in the GMO debate. If you want to prove a fault in science, use the tools scientists use, peer reviewed studies and unbiased information sources. If you don't have solid evidence, consider what a fool you are being. Shill shill shill just makes you look like a blathering idiot and forfeits every time, the win goes to science truth. The shill gambit failed debating tactic is explained simply in the dictionary of your choice. This is especially ludicrous when you consider the GMO safety debate ended two full years ago and no company for profit anywhere would spend a single penny paying a "shill" to promote something already attained in 2016 with release of that landmark NAS study.

You are very ignorant of the discipline and principles of science. No opinion matters, no feelings, hunches or naturalistic fallacies apply. ONLY what is proven, verified by peer review and consistently repeated is valid as science facts. There is no "you people" in existence outside of the ignorance of your own undisciplined mind. I pity the culture that created a dullard like you. The naturalistic fallacy is a classic debate blunder - google it. YOU eat extremely 'unnatural' foods every day, humans began altering all foods we eat from their natural states over 10,000 years ago. Virtually no food we farm is as it was originally. This all began the day man tamed fire eons ago. That permanently ended any 'natural' qualities in our lives.

NO!! No GMO tomatoes have been sold for 15 years. Only one company tried it, they were to prevent frost damage but it did not work well so it never sold much. Growers still need a frost resistant tomato but none are in the market. You have no proof any have been sold for 15 years since that Flavr-Savr tomato went out of business. Google it to see I am correct. You don't get to just make shit up and Youtube videos are constantly lying.

The only way we see something remotely like that happening in nature is when animals absorb and use toxins found in some foods they eat, then excrete them again as self defense. That is not genetic in nature.

No!! Not even close! As the video stated, the GMO Bt trait can ONLY affect one insect species and no other living thing. Those borer worm pests only thrive on farms, not in nature. Bt is not what you would imagine a poison or pesticide to be - it is just a very specific protein molecule naturally found in soil bacteria. Organic farmers have been using the Bt toxin for 40 years.

Your post is false Bt has even been proven to be safe by the Organic Industry and the rest of the world. Why would you want farmer to go back to using more and more harmful pesticides? What country are you from to be this misinformed? Please answer the simple question. Bt gmo technology is now being use in Europe as in all over the world. Organic growers have used Bt for decades even injecting some food with Bt. I am sure you have heard of Bt corn. Bt corn contains naturally occurring Bacillus thuringiensis bacteria, a result of recombinant DNA techniques. that selectively kill caterpillar pest. Organic growers have for decades approved sprays containing Bt, a naturally occurring soil bacterium. Bt produces biotoxins lethal to moths,caterpillars and butterflies when ingested. Because it targets these insects' intestinal membranes(ABSENT in HUMANS and ANIMALS ), the EPA considers it benign to non- caterpillar species, including beneficial insects. When Organic growers spray Bt they kill all moths,caterpillars, and butterflies but we do not do that with gmo corn because only corn bore and corn rootworms attacks corn so they are the only insects affected. For 80 years farmers like me used dangerous dangerous pesticides to control theses insects but today we do not have to use them thanks to gmo technology. GMO technology is safer for my children, my Wife, our water, our farm, and our environment. WE and YOU should give thanks to almighty GOD for the wisdom of GMO Technology.

It is a pathetic form of cheating by trying to poison the well rather than countering with a cogent refutation that might prove your point or win a debate. I see lameoids pull this stupid blunder 10 times a day in the GMO debate. If you want to prove a fault in science, use the tools scientists use, peer reviewed studies and unbiased information sources. If you don't have solid evidence, consider what a fool you are being. Shill shill shill just makes you look like a blathering idiot and forfeits every time, the win goes to science truth. The shill gambit failed debating tactic is explained simply in the dictionary of your choice. This is especially ludicrous when you consider the GMO safety debate ended two full years ago and no company for profit anywhere would spend a single penny paying a "shill" to promote something already attained in 2016 with release of that landmark NAS study.

No!!!! Of the millions of insect species, only one is our targeted crop pest. Borer worms, like the corn borer and the boll weevil have very specific cells that are the only living cells the GMO Bt protein molecule can bind with. No other living thing is affected by that Bt molecule. Those nasty pests are not common in nature, just on farms. There are millions of specific protein molecules and only one, found naturally in Bt soil bacteria, can affect those particular crop pests. This does function as a pesticide but it is not the typical chemical spray. Organic farmers have been using the Bt bacteria to treat their fields for 40 years. You have no valid concern.

All the corporate seed companies combined comprise less than 20% of our global seed supply. A partial list of the plethora of supply sources they can never touch: free NGO and government run seed programs, seed banks and vaults, seed exchanges, seed libraries, neighbors swapping seed, farm granges, online seed sales, small local farm supply stores, gardening supply stores, collecting seed from wild sources, countries like Mexico where GMO seed is rejected, China with its own GMO and conventional seed programs, Asshole Russia with their anti-GMO troll armies, seed saving practices, remote villages who never have and never will buy seed, and mountain terrace farmers at the ends of 200 kilometer long foot paths in mountainous regions of three continents. Are corporate seed sellers going to march jack booted thugs up those paths with packs full of seed they will force the remote villages to buy?? Myth busted!

All patents expire. Without them we would have no computers or internet personal electronics or big budget movies or premium medical care. Expired patent GMO corn, soybeans and alfalfa are generic and cheap now, a bargain for farmers. GMO corn seed just dropped $100 per bag in price! FARMERS DO NOT WANT TO REPLANT HYBRID SEEDS!!! Farmers quit saving Hybrid seed in mid 1930's and as each crop became a hybrid farmers quit saving seed from that crop. We have had patented seed ever since Congress passed the Plant Variety Protection Act in 1970 Protecting Plant Breeders with patent rights. It is illegal to save patented seed and does not mater if it is GMO or non GMO seed. Farmers are law abiding citizens but some think they are above the law. If you save seed do not buy patented seed to do so. A first grade child can understand that. There are many companies even foreign companies producing and selling GMO technology seed. That favorite whipping boy Monsanto was bought out and when it did exist it only controlled 20% of the GM seed market globally. Expired patent seed is a gift to humanity.

Bt resistance happens when it is not rotated properly and crop refuges are not employed. You don't know what a crop refuge is and I can't link that info on this channel.

This has been misused to argue that the genetic engineering itself was the primary cause of the contamination, a stance that was heavily criticized for overlooking the other [USER 152] non-GMO causes of contamination, as well as for its use by anti-GMO activists as a way to threaten the development of biotechnology with false information.[32] The reduction in the amount of activated carbon used and the introduction of the fifth generation Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain were both associated with the development of EMS, but due to the high overlap of these changes, the precise independent contribution of each change could not be determined" Wikipedia

All GMOs are tested for years IN ADVANCE before they are approved. They must prove SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCY which means there is nothing much different from the foods we already eat historically. There is no time delay nonsense, when you eat something bad you know within 20 minutes to 4 hours. Period.

It's a pity your science education is so bad and you then go on the web to wrongly attack our fine honest hard working farmers and crop scientists. You spelled glyphosate wrong too. Cancer is random and the number of cases of NHL have been steadily dropping for 40 years despite the huge increase in glyphosate use. You also have not heard that the IARC was busted for accepting a bribe from organic farmers, an activist lawyer delivered a $160,000 cash bribe to them to buy the very low risk classification for glyphosate which they claimed was equal to the risk from coffee, chocolate, fried potatoes and lunch meats. This particular channel blocks live links but I am willing to help you to see all the scathing coverage of the IARC bribery scandal if you are interested. The WHO castigated them for that corruption. This video is about scientific facts that are proven repeatedly, not about conspiracy theories. The glyphosate scandal is not over yet. No valid cancer research ever proved a cancer risk, just a few faked studies that were easily debunked. Seralini was the fraud who started that myth, he was funded by organic farming interests. I really would like to help you to be very sure every word I posted here is absolutely true. Just ask questions. Ground [USER 112] for GMO education is the non-profit GeneticLiteracyProject dot org - I donate to it every year.

You are almost correct but the 3 letters GMO have a very specific meaning - laboratory altered DNA. Yes, conventional breeding, seed selection and grafting can do much the same thing, just much slower.

There are no studies for that GMO bogeyman because it can not exist. GMOs are just food, plain old food. We don't do long term studies on the low-dose effects of carrots or cauliflower either, other than nutrition studies. The first rule to get any GMO approved is called substantial equivalency. Drastic differences are not allowed except in research labs.

Playing the shill gambit is always a forfeit of the debate at hand. It is a pathetic form of cheating by trying to poison the well rather than countering with a cogent refutation that might prove your point or win a debate. I see lameoids pull this stupid blunder 10 times a day in the GMO debate. If you want to prove a fault in science, use the tools scientists use, peer reviewed studies and unbiased information sources. If you don't have solid evidence, consider what a fool you are being. Shill shill shill just makes you look like a blathering idiot and forfeits every time, the win goes to science truth. The shill gambit failed debating tactic is explained simply in the dictionary of your choice. This is especially ludicrous when you consider the GMO safety debate ended two full years ago and no company for profit anywhere would spend a single penny paying a "shill" to promote something already attained in 2016 with release of that landmark NAS study.

Almost' JUST POSTED HIS 168th BLATANT BALD FACED LIE ABOUT HUMAN SAFETY TESTING. THIS IS REFUTATION NUMBER 168 COMPLETE WITH HYPERLINK OF PROOF THAT PROVES THE '[USER 89]' TROLL IS LYING FOR THE 168th TIME: Human safety feeding trials study, including quantified human risk assessment, that trolls say do not exist: Golden rice is designed to make a change in the human body with Vit. A. This is an exception to most GMO foods so Codex compliant human testing was done. Here is the study that verified the human safety and nutrition trials: ncbi dot nlm dot nih dot gov/pmc/articles/ PMC2682994/ Note that only one serving per person was required to verify the proper nutrition from golden rice. Additional servings would be a waste of time, as determined by multiple safety agencies who peer reviewed the process.
"So "why don't we do clinical trials on GMOs the same way we do for drugs?" Drugs are designed to cause a change in the human body: that's the whole point behind them. Since drugs are altering something in humans, it's important to know the side-effects that they may cause and whether or not they're causing the anticipated effect (i.e. is it better than placebo). In contrast, GMOs are designed to be equivalent to their non-GE counterparts: they aren't drugs or nutritional supplements." geneticliteracyproject[dot]org/2016/01/13/ no-long-term-gmo -studies-humans/

ALL READERS - Go to the dot gov sites for the FDA, USDA & EPA to easily find out this asshole is a severely demented liar. Over 75 mandatory tests are required before any GMO is approved, this takes years to complete. If the producers do not provide verifiable documented evidence that all tests have been completed the seed will not be approved. The FDA does on site audits and interviews for confirmation. The FDA wrote the Codex for the world and they sure as hell are not going to violate their own guidelines. Only Trump does that. The entire world celebrates the triumph of GMO crop science.

You are ignorant of this topic and science illiterate. The Bt GMO crops need no insecticides. The GMO trait that works with glyphosate allows farmers to use the safest herbicide ever formulated - it is 43% less toxic to humans than table salt, and it washes off in rain, then gets broken down in the soil. YOU are the sick psychopath for mindlessly attacking the best and safest crop science that farmers asked for. Beneficial insect populations are healthy in GMO crop fields, only the borer worm pests that exist in unnaturally high numbers on farms are killed and there is no way we could ever extinct them but that would be a wonderful thing for humanity. To "kill off species' we'd have to spray the entire global land mass from sea to sea and pole to pole you dumb ass.

No. That is an ignorant thing to suggest. There is no GMO bogeyman. Evolution has always dealt with all mutations of every sort, that is not stopping now. GMO foods are the only breeding method tested for years before approval. What is not tested, ever, for safety?? Organic, heirloom, hybrid and new truck farm breeds. They go straight to store shelves with [USER 112] testing and YOU are the guinea pig. Look at what has happened because of this fact that never happened with GMO foods: "A year ago[2003] in New Zealand, there was an outbreak of food poisoning from a "killer zucchini" that hospitalized a number of people. Environmentalists jumped all over the story until it was determined that the culprit was "organic" zucchini. Plants are chemical factories that produce a multitude of toxins that protect them. An outbreak of aphid infestation had minimal impact on conventionally grown zucchini. The more vulnerable "organic" zucchini was genetically inferior because of inbreeding. They expressed dangerously high levels of the toxin curcubitan. Had this been a transgenic plant, we would be hearing about it ad nauseam, but being that it was "organic," it was quickly consigned to an Orwellian memory hole." uh[dot]edu/~trdegreg/genetic_engineering_not_significantly.htm

You need to understand that a naturally balanced population of borer worms exists in nature, outside the borders of farms. Farmers don't treat the entire globe, only their fields. If they become effectively extinct on farms only it would be a wonderful thing that would end hunger. An insect that could only survive as a species on farms is not a naturally evolved insect - it could not have lived more than 10,000 years ago when farming began.

No. There is no issue in the real world, only as pumped by conspiracy theories and activist groups funded by organic lobbyists. They don't want you to know that organic seeds have patents too. The video did not mention this because it is not an actual controversy. Patents are vital for growing commerce. You would have no computer or internet or digital devices without patent protection. No company did what you described, they have to prove there is a valuable trait and that it can pass the years of safety testing before any GMO is approved. They NEVER attempt to claim the whole plant was their "invention" you liar. GM seed is identified by traits that are added as added value to farmers. You must have visited dishonest activist sites funded by organic lobbyists to pick up this nasty lie.

ALL SEED PATENTS EXPIRE after 20 years. GMO corn, soybeans and alfalfa are generic and cheap now, a bargain for farmers. GMO corn seed just dropped $100 per bag in price! FARMERS DO NOT WANT TO REPLANT HYBRID SEEDS!!! Farmers quit saving Hybrid seed in mid 1930's and as each crop became a hybrid farmers quit saving seed from that crop. We have had patented seed ever since Congress passed the Plant Variety Protection Act in 1970 Protecting Plant Breeders with patent rights. It is illegal to save patented seed and does not mater if it is GMO or non GMO seed. Farmers are law abiding citizens but some think they are above the law. If you save seed do not buy patented seed to do so. A first grade child can understand that. There are many companies even foreign companies producing and selling GMO technology seed. That favorite whipping boy Monsanto was bought out and when it did exist it only controlled 20% of the GM seed market globally. Expired patent seed is a gift to humanity.

More than half of all GMO seeds being used today (by variety, not tonnage) are not for US agribusiness. They are for specific applications in many different parts of the world where climate change is causing additional challenges. Most of them are not patented. Most of them are given away free to struggling farmers by NGOs and govt seed programs.

Look at what has happened because of this fact that never happened with GMO foods: "A year ago[2003] in New Zealand, there was an outbreak of food poisoning from a "killer zucchini" that hospitalized a number of people. Environmentalists jumped all over the story until it was determined that the culprit was "organic" zucchini. Plants are chemical factories that produce a multitude of toxins that protect them. An outbreak of aphid infestation had minimal impact on conventionally grown zucchini. The more vulnerable "organic" zucchini was genetically inferior because of inbreeding. They expressed dangerously high levels of the toxin curcubitan. Had this been a transgenic plant, we would be hearing about it ad nauseam, but being that it was "organic," it was quickly consigned to an Orwellian memory hole."

The second most popular GM trait is the Bt version that reproduces the same protein that is found naturally in Bt soil bacteria. Organic farmers have been using a Bt spray for 40 years. Corn with the Bt trait added saves the farmers from having to spray to kill borer worm pests. A very specific protein molecule only affects the gut of borer worm pests and no other living thing.

FALSE. Bt gmo technology is now being use in Europe as in all over the world. Organic growers have used Bt for decades even injecting some food with Bt. I am sure you have heard of Bt corn. Bt corn contains naturally occurring Bacillus thuringiensis bacteria, a result of recombinant DNA techniques. that selectively kill caterpillar pest. Organic growers have for decades approved sprays containing Bt, a naturally occurring soil bacterium. Bt produces biotoxins lethal to moths,caterpillars and butterflies when ingested. Because it targets these insects' intestinal membranes(ABSENT in HUMANS and ANIMALS ), the EPA considers it benign to non- caterpillar species, including beneficial insects. When Organic growers spray Bt they kill all moths,caterpillars, and butterflies but we do not do that with gmo corn because only corn bore and corn rootworms attacks corn so they are the only insects affected. For 80 years farmers like me used dangerous dangerous pesticides to control theses insects but today we do not have to use them thanks to gmo technology. GMO technology is safer for my children, my Wife, our water, our farm, and our environment. WE and YOU should give thanks to almighty GOD for the wisdom of GMO Technology.

Horseshit. There are no GMO peanuts or chocolate. That leaves sweeteners and oils - under our new GE disclosure law in effect this year, it is now illegal to identify any refined sugars or oils GMO. Why? Because all refined foods are stripped of any DNA or proteins. This fact means that organic, heirloom, conventional and GMO grown foods all are chemically identical. There is a grace period after which the number of foods listing GE ingredients will be far fewer and the only indicator will be a tiny icon. Thank you President Obama for stopping those nasty organic lobbyists from turning food labels into a fear mongering program to sell more inferior organic foods!

NOTHING WHATSOEVER HAPPENS
when humans eat foods with the Bt molecule - organic farmers have been using Bt for 40 years. The natural soil bacteria Bt has a molecule that is extremely specific in compatibility, it can only bind with cells in borer worm pests, and no other living thing. GMO Bt crops use this same molecule which is inert to all living things besides borer worms. It already exists in nature and of all the things we should worry about in sewage, Bt is definitely not one of them. Bt has always been in the food chain. I repeat - no other living thing anywhere can be affected by the Bt molecule.

No!!! That is a lie! Italian farmers organized to get GMO crop cultivation bans lifted in some regions of Italy. Your claim that "all" are banned is entirely false. "As a member of the European Union, Italy has been implementing European directives concerning genetically modified organisms (GMOs) over the last two decades, but at a rather reluctant pace. In fact, as reflected by GMO legislation in Italy, Italian public opinion has shifted from a decidedly general opposition to the introduction of GMOs into a more recent open acceptance of them. Italy’s political and administrative structure relies on the powers of the central government and the governments of its twenty regions, which enjoy certain autonomy in the regulation of agriculture and crops, and in experimentation with GMOs. As a consequence, some regions have enacted slightly more permissive regimes than others. In addition, the Italian Constitutional Court has ruled that the national government is constrained from encroaching on the power of regional governments to establish their own regimes on GMOs. This factor, in conjunction with the more permissive regulations to which Italy is bound at the European level, creates a scenario where the decentralized and spontaneous growth of GMOs in agriculture will probably increase in the near future." loc[dot]gov/law/help/restrictions-on-gmos/italy[dot]php

Horseshit. Federal law demands that any GMO that is approved must be totally equivalent to its non-GMO counterparts in all ways. This includes testing for full digestibility and 75 other factors your poor education prevents you from understanding. Heartburn? There is no excuse for that discomfort in 2020. We easily treat all such cases as long as people eat sensibly.
Stupidity is far more difficult to treat.

This shows why you have no business criticizing anything. You have a poor education. Are you an 8th grade student? How do you not grasp that fire was the beginning of the modern age? It allowed us to cook meats so it digested easier which sent us on our way to larger brain size. That in turn led to the farming era and to the steam age and then to the mechanical age and finally the technology age. You are NOT smarter than the world's scientists who all understand technology light years beyond your poor education. They ARE thinking long term and they ARE thinking advanced agriculture for over population and climate change challenges. This is where GM science is essential for our survival. The wealthiest countries are also leading the way to sustainability and that includes advanced crop science. Even African nations are now embracing the best crop science. Seems that even those stone age poorly educated Africans are smarter than you......

That discusses POTENTIAL for improvements that have not yet been done to any tomato. Cartoons are for short attention span kids and uneducated adults. Forget Youtube, just google 'GMO tomato facts' to learn that none are sold in the US for the last 15 years. There was one GMO tomato registered 15 years ago that was meant to reduce frost damage but it was not cold resistant enough to matter. GMO seeds are not sold to gardeners anyways. There are literally hundreds of Youtube videos and video thumbnails of tomatoes with a fake GMO label on them, or showing that idiotic false image of them being injected with a hypodermic needle. They are all 100% lies! No needles are ever used on any GMO food. Ironically, organic farmers are the only ones using needles to inject the Bt toxin directly into the bases of their plants.

Your experience is an example of how plant breeders can pick out aberrations in plants and use those seeds to breed a tomato with the traits they want. Some prefer purple tomatoes and pay extra for that seed. The source you bought your seeds from was obviously not a reliable respected seed seller, not because there is any health threat but because customers expect to get what they pay for. Your purple tomatoes will be highly nutritious. Or if you just planted the seeds from grape domatoes you bought in the grocery you learned how hybrids are meant to grow as predicted only once.

The Bt toxin is a protein molecule that can only find receptors to bind with in the guts of borer worm pests. Bt is a natural soil bacteria and organic farmers have used it heavily for 40 years. A human can eat a chunk of pure Bt protein, enough to kill thousands of pests, with no effect. This experiment has been done and documented. The Bt molecule does not show up in corn ears, just in the stalks.

Your post is garbage and shows how clueless you are on this subject. Bt gmo technology is now being use in Europe as in all over the world. Organic growers have used Bt for decades even injecting some food with Bt. I am sure you have heard of Bt corn. Bt corn contains naturally occurring Bacillus thuringiensis bacteria, a result of recombinant DNA techniques. that selectively kill caterpillar pest. Organic growers have for decades approved sprays containing Bt, a naturally occurring soil bacterium. Bt produces biotoxins lethal to moths,caterpillars and butterflies when ingested. Because it targets these insects' intestinal membranes(ABSENT in HUMANS and ANIMALS ), the EPA considers it benign to non- caterpillar species, including beneficial insects. When Organic growers spray Bt they kill all moths,caterpillars, and butterflies but we do not do that with gmo corn because only corn bore and corn rootworms attacks corn so they are the only insects affected. For 80 years farmers like me used dangerous dangerous pesticides to control theses insects but today we do not have to use them thanks to gmo technology. GMO technology is safer for my children, my Wife, our water, our farm, and our environment. WE and YOU should give thanks to almighty GOD for the wisdom of GMO Technology.

Yes that is fake news. A win means the settlement was ACTUALLY PAID but not one penny has been paid out. Why? 2 reasons - juries do not make science facts. And the whole premise is based on bribery: Organic farmers sent a $160,000 cash bribe to the IARC through a corrupt USRTK lawyer to get them to make the low cancer risk statement about glyphosate. It was the cornerstone of all these shyster lawyer Roundup lawsuits but now that Congress has cut off its $2mill annual finding to the IARC they are in deep doodoo.

It didn't accomplish that as well as expected and it was never marketed to any degree. Ever since then for 15 years, lying assholes have been citing GMO tomatoes as an abomination that is in stores today despite the fact they were never sold!! We see hundreds of fraudulent fear mongering images on Youtube thumbnails of tomatoes being injected with hypodermic needles despite the fact that needles are never involved in any part of the GMO process and GMO tomatoes were never sold. Why the fuck would you post that lie about 'the living crap"??
ASSHOLE
Tomatoes have gone through a breeding trend over the decades to make them faster growing, longer lasting on shelves and this was done without making retaining best flavor the top priority. Farmers and breeders are now very aware of how consumers are not happy with the loss of flavor as a trade for longer shelf life so the trend has reversed. In the last year several new breeds that are truly delicious like home garden fresh have hit the market. They are selling well. None of them are GMO. Yet.

The cheating started when man tamed fire. As our population continued to cheat nature as we grew too large over the last 10,000 years we have had to breed all foods we eat for maximum performance. This will become more urgent every year until we stop breeding like bunnies.

It's a good thing that opinions have no merit here. Only a few countries have a falling population, all the others still grow at disastrous rates. Waste in some countries can not be transferred to remote regions of starvation. GMO seed can prevent the massive crop failures that cause mass migration refugees. NGO workers have died trying to get food to the starving, they can help themselves with the right seed which is being given to them free.

All farming of every type is invasive to nature. GMO crops are more efficient and use less pesticides so they have the lowest impact.

It is a fact that all large trees sequester carbon. Planting a million fast growing chestnuts to replace what was lost would be very good for the environment. "Jul 1, 2009 - The trees eventually absorb the same amount of carbon, but the fast-growing chestnut can store more carbon in a shorter amount of time, Jacobs said. The tree was found to carry up to three times the biomass of the others at various points in its growth cycle." scientificamerican dot com/article/chestnut-tree-climate-change-carbon/

No, You said it was engineered to resist the disease. If you did a search you would not have posted this rude challenge to KZGT based on a false premise. They did not say the advantage was 'extra' carbon sequestration, it was the fact that these fast growing trees can hold carbon because they were engineered to resist the disease. It would be a LOT of carbon because a LOT of them would be planted and they grow fast, making them a good emergency measure for an urgent need. You went off half cocked. Until the fungus is dealt with they can hold no carbon at all. The difference between nothing and a large amount is beyond you? The link I posted confirms there IS an advantage to GM chestnuts that suit our needs so don't try to squirm out of this. You were caught.

You chose the worst possible video for debate - this channel blocks live links. I have 5 links that prove the following and I normally provide the links of proof but here I had to cut them out. You can verify this easily with a search, Wikipedia is one place to start, it has many footnote links:
Myth about Agent Orange being Monsanto's creation, supported by 5 citation links: "Agent Orange is the name given to the combination of two commercially available herbicides[2,4-D & 2,4,5-T] which had been used for decades before the Vietnam War. The former Monsanto, which was primarily a chemical company, along with 9 other companies, supplied the U.S. government these herbicides as part of the war effort. The combination of these herbicides is what the U.S. government named Agent Orange after the colour of the stripe put on the barrels that contained it.
The nine Agent Orange manufacturers were government contractors acting at the direction of the government, which was exercising its authority under the U.S. War Powers Act. The government set the manufacturing specifications for Agent Orange, and decided when, where and how it was used. Agent Orange was only made for military use by the government.
In 2009, the U.S. Supreme Court let stand lower court rulings that the manufacturers were not responsible for the implications of military use of Agent Orange because the war materials were supplied at the direction of the U.S. government."

Lie!!! Like just about everyone else here you don't know what the fuck you are talking about.
Glyphosate, 2,4-D and dicamba are the primary GMO pesticides.
"Rotenone is a selective, non-specific insecticide with some acaricidal properties. Rotenone is used in home gardens for insect control, for lice and tick control on pets and for fish eradications as part of water body management. The use of the pesticide for control of fish and in cranberries is restricted by the Environmental Protection Agency.
Rotenone is a rotenoid plant extract obtained from such species as barbasco, cub, haiari, nekoe, and timbo. These plants are members of the pea (Leguminosae) family. Rotenone containing extracts are taken from the roots, seeds and leaves of the various plants (13). Rotenone is generally classified as a botanical insecticide.
Rotenone is a general use pesticide."

There are NO 'side effects' at all, compared to any other farming method. You are repeating lies made up by organic lobbyists.

Your post is garbage Walter. We have had patented seed both gmo and non gmo every since Congress passed the Plant Variety Protection Act in 1970 Protecting Plant Breeders with Patented Rights. Any seed company will sue a farmer if he breaks the Law and tries to save patented seed for planting next years crop. That is illegal. Laws are made for everyone to obey not just a few. If you do not like the laws then work to change them. Farmers Overwhelmingly freely choose gmo technology seed in the world if it is an option even though it cost more. Not all crops use gmo technology.

When you object to patents you object to all technology such as what you are using to post this. Monsanto shut down over two years ago! You do not speak for farmers as a farmer. Your words only repeat conspiracy theories and your channel page is blank. You are just as likely a Russian troll or an organic industry operative. That ignorant food bully 'Food Babe' launched that idiotic attack on rBST, a harmless improvement to milk. Our court system can not be played or abused. Yes lawyers try all the time, like with the current Roundup cancer lawsuits but not one penny has been paid out. Not one Monsanto lawsuit has ever seen a conviction unless there was CLEAR PROVEN CRIMINAL INTENT by the farmer, proven in court.

False premise. You posted a lie and then asked a question about your lie fantasy. The cost of food in the EU is very high compared to the US and we live longer with lower cancer rates than the EU, when adjusted to ignore our opioid epidemic. We eat more GMO foods and have less cancer. You are also lying about 'foreign people's eating habits' and preferences - your immigrants eat a lot of Halal and kosher foods and many are vegetarian. They have their Jewish, schwarma, Indian, Pakistani, Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Thai foods, to name a few. You are full of shit.

You ignorant fool - Monsanto shut down over two years ago. And you tried to play the shill card - you just forfeit. Playing the shill gambit is always a forfeit of the debate at hand. It is a pathetic form of cheating by trying to poison the well rather than countering with a cogent refutation that might prove your point or win a debate. I see lameoids pull this stupid blunder 10 times a day in the GMO debate. If you want to prove a fault in science, use the tools scientists use, peer reviewed studies and unbiased information sources. If you don't have solid evidence, consider what a fool you are being.

Where the hell have you been for the last 50 years? We have an extreme planetary emergency due to the high co2 levels. In part from CUTTING DOWN TOO MANY TREES!! It is absolutely impossible for the greatly diminished existing stands of trees to extract "too much". Even if we could magically restore the half of Earth's forests that have been cut down the co2 would remain dangerously high for decades.

You heard wrong. There is no such thing as "weird junk in bugs". Activists funded by organic farmers spread every possible lie about totally safe GMO foods. NGOs and government seed programs are finally beating hunger for the first time by developing and giving away free GMO seed. Search Youtube for brinjal eggplant in Bangladesh for an excellent example.

We remain omnivores if we only eat 8 ounces of meat per month, or 80 pounds. Where we lived and the seasons determine the mix, obviously. Wild plants vary 'wildly' in nutrition and ease of eating. Berries were always berries. Seaweed and coconuts and dates are unchanged. Roots are still roots, even yucca or potatoes. [USER 209 NAME]hey are larger but still what we ate in the beginning.

Shill card. You lose by forfeit. Playing the shill gambit is always a forfeit of the debate at hand. It is a pathetic form of cheating by trying to poison the well rather than countering with a cogent refutation that might prove your point or win a debate. I see lameoids pull this stupid blunder 10 times a day in the GMO debate. If you want to prove a fault in science, use the tools scientists use, peer reviewed studies and unbiased information sources. If you don't have solid evidence, consider what a fool you are being.

Several false premises in your post - GMO foods are NOT new organisms - we have been eating these plants for over 10,000 years. The first rule when submitting any new GM seed for testing for FDA, USDA & EPA approval is that it must be SUBSTANTIALLY EQUIVALENT to the non-GM version or it will not be approved. Over 75 tests take years to complete. Any issue you can think of is already being tested for in advance. They are released with the exact opposite of 'little care". What ever gave you such an idea? Natural News? A Youtube trash video by a fraud?

That's the naturalistic fallacy. GMOs all use plants that came out of evolution and 10,000 years of human breeding methods.
There is no GMO bogeyman. Pest resistance has been a challenge for farmers for over 200 years. They know how to control it with crop and pesticide rotation to prevent resistance buildup. In fact it is GMO science which will create enough different strains to make control by rotation easier.

The mentally ill obsessed liar troll 'Almost' JUST POSTED HIS 160th BLATANT BALD FACED LIE ABOUT HUMAN SAFETY TESTING. THIS IS REFUTATION NUMBER 160 COMPLETE WITH HYPERLINKS OF PROOF THAT PROVES THE '[USER 89]' TROLL IS LYING FOR THE 160th TIME: Human safety feeding trials study, including quantified human risk assessment, that trolls say do not exist: Golden rice is designed to make a change in the human body with Vit. A. This is an exception to most GMO foods so Codex compliant human testing was done. Here is the study that verified the human safety and nutrition trials: ncbi dot nlm dot nih dot gov/pmc/articles/ PMC2682994/ Note that only one serving per person was required to verify the proper nutrition from golden rice. Additional servings would be a waste of time, as determined by multiple safety agencies who peer reviewed the process.
"So "why don't we do clinical trials on GMOs the same way we do for drugs?" Drugs are designed to cause a change in the human body: that's the whole point behind them. Since drugs are altering something in humans, it's important to know the side-effects that they may cause and whether or not they're causing the anticipated effect (i.e. is it better than placebo). In contrast, GMOs are designed to be equivalent to their non-GE counterparts: they aren't drugs or nutritional supplements." geneticliteracyproject dot org/2016/01/13/ no-long-term-gmo -studies-humans/

Pharma has nothing to do with farming. A common meme we all hear if we are exposed to lying activist sites and videos is that the Monsanto boogeyman and "corporations" want to "control the world's seed supply". Let's ponder that for a moment which is all it takes to realize how absurd and ignorant that meme really is. First of all, Monsanto shut down over two years ago. All the corporate seed companies combined comprise less than 20% of our global seed supply. A partial list of the plethora of supply sources they can never touch: free NGO and government run seed programs, seed banks and vaults, seed exchanges, seed libraries, neighbors swapping seed, farm granges, online seed sales, small local farm supply stores, gardening supply stores, collecting seed from wild sources, countries like Mexico where GMO seed is rejected, China with its own GMO and conventional seed programs, Asshole Russia with their anti-GMO troll armies, seed saving practices, remote villages who never have and never will buy seed, and mountain terrace farmers at the ends of 200 kilometer long foot paths in mountainous regions of three continents. Are corporate seed sellers going to march jack booted thugs up those paths with packs full of seed they will force the remote villages to buy?? Myth busted!

You are clueless. Bt gmo technology is now being use in Europe as in all over the world. Organic growers have used Bt for decades even injecting some food with Bt. I am sure you have heard of Bt corn. Bt corn contains naturally occurring Bacillus thuringiensis bacteria, a result of recombinant DNA techniques. that selectively kill caterpillar pest. Organic growers have for decades approved sprays containing Bt, a naturally occurring soil bacterium. Bt produces biotoxins lethal to moths,caterpillars and butterflies when ingested. Because it targets these insects' intestinal membranes(ABSENT in HUMANS and ANIMALS ), the EPA considers it benign to non- caterpillar species, including beneficial insects. When Organic growers spray Bt they kill all moths,caterpillars, and butterflies but we do not do that with gmo corn because only corn bore and corn rootworms attacks corn so they are the only insects affected. For 80 years farmers like me used dangerous dangerous pesticides to control theses insects but today we do not have to use them thanks to gmo technology. GMO technology is safer for my children, my Wife, our water, our farm, and our environment. WE and YOU should give thanks to almighty GOD for the wisdom of GMO Technology.

You are revealed as a fool if you can not tell us about the latest case of food being "poisoned" by GMO farmers. Tell us the date, the city where it happened and the poison used. All intentional "poisoning" of food is a crime and foods can be traced to their origin. Offenders a caught, arrested, tried and jailed. he last two food poisonings on the news his week were beef contaminated with salmonella and organic food contaminated with e-coli. No GMO foods have been in the news this year about poisoning.

One way your stupidity keeps you down is that you have no ability to decide what accurate unbiased information looks like. "I marvel at how anti-ag “shockumentaries” never fall into that rut. You know, in the time-honored, inflammatory vein of “Food Inc.,” “Cowspiracy,” “Farmageddon,” etc. Through clever wordplays, provocative imagery, and anecdotes, they appeal to the everyman/woman in us all. The directors know how to press the right buttons — they have the pseudoscience down to a science.
These glorified infomercials are entertaining (in a cringey way), just insufferably formulaic. They dredge up the same old tired, recycled arguments. They artfully embellish with alternative facts and ignore whatever doesn’t suit. It banks on shallow soundbytes taken at face value, rather than a critical analysis of content. In effect, predatory messaging for the masses.
Thanks to Sound Speed PR, I recently had the opportunity to review a new entry to the shockumentary genre: “Secret Ingredients.” True to form, it’s an alphabet soup of common gripes, all rolled into a tidy package. Essentially, the duo of GMOs and Roundup are responsible for all our chronic health ills. The tabloid-esque assertions are so absurd, and the visuals so comically overblown (a butterfly fleeing in terror from a cropduster, and a Monsanto-branded tanker truck ferrying Roundup and Agent Orange on the road?) it seemingly borders on self-parody. But it’s deadly serious.
The messaging relies too heavily on absurd reductionism. The core message is that all of our health ills can be attributed to just a couple of dubious actors. By withdrawing these players from our diets, we can experience a near instantaneous health renewal. These calls for a health renaissance are delectably simple and elegant — and also laughably wrong. It desperately needs a dose of narrative Pepto-Bismol. So where did it go astray? Let me count the ways.
The brainchild of this opus is Jeffery Smith, of the Institute for Responsible Technology, with a special guest appearance by [USER 219] Honeycutt of Moms Across America, among others. You know you’re in for an [USER 218] pilgrimage into factual no-man’s land. At the title screen, “Secret Ingredients” wafts insidiously from a loaded dinner plate. It starts with a family beset with tragedy — all sorts of chronic conditions cropping up (21 in all), including autism. And these were self-described health nuts. So the mom embarks on an odyssey of discovery to connect the dots. After doing “research” (a common trope for those dissatisfied with modern science), the answer was obvious — ditch the GMOs and Roundup!
We’re told that “independent” scientists disagree about the health consensus surrounding GMOs — implying that they have the moral scruples to resist pro-GMO payola. For their integrity, they’re the victims of a vicious industry response that punishes anyone who dares to question. There’s even mention of Bt insecticidal proteins made by select GMO crops — and how those proteins carve holes in the guts of insect pests, killing them. Imagine what it would do to us! Well, nothing actually. We lack the proper gut receptors to latch on to. We also don’t have alkaline guts, another prerequisite. No overdose of Tums is going to change that. There’s also the fact that Bt has been sprayed organically for 90 years. Live, formulated, chemical payloads. A pesticide. Spray it or give the plant the ability to make it in-house. There’s no meaningful difference, except in delivery.
The most hate seems to be directed at Roundup. According to the film’s “esteemed” experts, Roundup and GMOs are two peas in a pod. It’s implicated in body burden (all the toxins that accrue in our systems and screw up the works). A pediatrician confidently states that we should go organic to avoid GMOs (generally true if you want to avoid them), and pesticides (I’d check your references). And when she wrote this “prescription,” the results were miraculous!
When a child was tested for glyphosate, he had 8x higher levels than those in Europe (are we going to quibble about near-nil and closer to near-nil levels?) Are those levels biologically impactful? Not at all. More than 40 years to data can attest to that.
And don’t forget the generic catch-all condition of “inflammation” and the clinically unrecognized “leaky gut”. Autism, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and brain fog, “Secret Ingredients” says they’re all singularly due to Roundup. Clinical mic drop! Futurist Carl Sagan claimed that “extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.” “Secret Ingredients” takes the proverbial cake. From a coarse understanding of the scientific method, including a lack of reproducibility and corroborating evidence and cherry-picking, the empirical and ethical lapses are striking."

No. You are not getting accurate information. The issues with pesticides have been investigated carefully by science and they found you were getting counterfeit and contaminated pesticides and your workers were ignoring all the label warnings about handling them safely. You should never let children work in those fields under any circumstances. You should never come home covered in pesticide residues and expose your family to it. You have to follow the instructions exactly and not let land owners force you to use pesticides improperly. You even let malicious activists photograph your children with burns from fires and claim it was pesticide injury. We have all the data needed, you just have to use and respect it.

I never claimed this was "about me" in any way. You just made that stupid shit up because you have no debating skills. I never need to make a single assumption or post a single personal opinion because there is a mountain of verified peer reviewed information about this topic, especially what is going on in your region. There were no verified peer reviewed valid "studies and observations" of the type you dishonestly claim happened. Anti-science activists flooded the internet and local press with fear mongering lies 4 years ago and since then all the claims have been systematically debunked and exposed. This peer reviewed study debunks your zika conspiracy theories: "The present study investigates the characteristics of discussion of conspiracy theories about the Zika virus outbreak of 2015–16 on Twitter. Content and social network analysis of a dataset of 25,162 original Tweets about Zika virus conspiracy theories showed that relative to debunking messages, conspiracy theories spread through a more decentralized network, are more likely to invoke supposedly knowledgeable authorities in making arguments, and ask more rhetorical questions. These trends can be understood in the context of previous work on conspiracy theories, including the “just asking questions” style of rhetoric, the importance of sourcing and authority, and the tendency to simultaneously consider many different potential conspiracies that might underlie an important topic or event." ncbi dot nlm dot nih dot gov/pmc/articles/PMC6094351/

It is important to mention the Zika conspiracy theory as a example of how ignorant SA people are. Human errors and corruption on a massive scale are the issue with pesticide issues in SA. Nobody here besides YOU mentioned "children playing with pesticides". They don't play with them they are used as child slave labor to apply pesticides while being provided no protective gear as is always required on the warning labels. SA is a land of ignorance and corruption. It has no responsible safety laws to protect farmers from unregulated and unapproved pesticides, or to demand they wear protective gear. You can not win a losing argument.

YOU mentioned South America. The stupid Zika lies and conspiracy theories generated in SA are a prime example of the culture of lies and corruption in your third world continent. Glyphosate is 43% less toxic to humans than table salt. It is by far the least toxic herbicide ever formulated. If it is "dangerous" what are all the other pesticides that are far more toxic? End of the world? If so, you should thank god for glyphosate. GMO crop science is a blessing. Thank goodness FDA and EPA testing of foods no longer finds dangerous levels of Atrazine, paraquat, DDT, fludioxonil, metolaclor, acephate and diazinon. Now they find minute traces of the least toxic herbicide ever formulated, glyphosate, which is 43% less toxic than table salt, and Bt, so non-toxic that organic farmers rely on it heavily. WHAT A DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENT!!!! Anti-GMO idiots claim they want to go back to that nightmare list of much more toxic pesticides. Why???? I can't imagine.

No. You are very uninformed. Ever single GMO seed, with no exceptions, undergoes years of testing before approval. Every potential issue is tested for in advance and not approved unless it is safe. USDA, FDA & EPA regulations demand over 75 tests that take time and money to complete. As a result there has been no documented harm from any GMO food. BUT there are a million liars who effectively spread fear mongering nonsense and demand special labels.

Again you are wrong. ANY land that is cleared and planted with ANY crop - organic, heirloom, conventional or GMO is harmed because all farming is invasive to nature. GMO crops are identical in impact to other farming operations. There is no such thing as a "self sustained plant" in farming. All plants we grow have been vastly altered by man over the last 10,000 years. GMO seed is a gift to humanity when the patents expire, or from the start when non-profits donate the seed to struggling farmers.
Thank goodness FDA and EPA testing of foods no longer finds dangerous levels of Atrazine, paraquat, DDT, fludioxonil, metolaclor, acephate and diazinon.

Nothing has "failed". All GMOs give us improvements that help farmers. There is no reason for GMO if it did not improve farming. All GMOs are 100% predictable the same as other crops we grow. But GMO has a more predicable yield for farmers.

False. Please complete your grade school education. We have been changing DNA in all foods we farm for 10,000 years. We are solving serous problems with GMO crop science. This will increase and you fools will be remembered as ignorant, trying to stand in the way of progress.

Monsanto shut down over TWO YEARS AGO you idiot!!! I'm retired. A full human generation has thrived on GMO foods and glyphosate instead of much more toxic pesticides. Thank goodness FDA and EPA testing of foods no longer finds dangerous levels of Atrazine, paraquat, DDT, fludioxonil, metolaclor, acephate and diazinon. Now they find minute traces of the least toxic herbicide ever formulated, glyphosate, which is 43% less toxic than table salt, and Bt, so non-toxic that organic farmers rely on it heavily. WHAT A DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENT!!!! Anti-GMO idiots claim they want to go back to that nightmare list of much more toxic pesticides. Why???? I can't imagine.

- go to the actual NAS report to see this mentally ill lying sack of shit is cherry picking and distorting the wording of that huge historic NAS study that had a FAVORABLE report on GMOs, so favorable it ended the GMO safety debate forever and this became settled science. Note that no human safety testing is required or desired for GMO foods, risk and substantial equivalency is screened for up front before any GMO is approved for sale. Codex DOES NOT require human safety testing. Here is what this asshole does not want you to see - the link to the study. This channel blocks live links, the main reason this stupid motherfucker infects this thread. Just replace the 'dot' with real dots to make this link work: nas-sites dot org/ge-crops/2016/05/16/report-in-brief/ Their site has been upgraded with videos to explain the findings and facts that are free of the tyranny of organic foods lobbyist lies.

All possible factors that trigger allergies are tested for and screened in advance, before any GMO is approved. No new allergies are ever caused by GMO foods that were not already in the systems of people before. Immune system effects are also screened for safety, none have ever been detected. The USDA, FDA & EPA HAVE OVER 75 TESTS that must be passed before any GMO is approved. This takes years to complete. Systematic debunking of the myth that GMOs have caused an increase in ALLERGIES : "There is no short list of culprits. Microbiome, Western diet, and socioeconomic status to name a few. A number of groups have also blamed genetically modified food. According to the Organic Consumers Association, the main trade group for the organic food industry. However, of the foods that most frequently cause food allergy, GM versions simply don’t exist.
There is no GM peanut (although development of a hypoallergenic GM peanut is ongoing). There is no GM milk. Or consumable GM egg (although there is now that makes medicine). However, a few cases of allergenicity cropped up during early experiments involving genetically engineered foods, which piqued concerns. [this mandatory testing prevented them from being approved]
European Union health agencies, and member nation health agencies, as well as the US FDA, EPA and USDA, are all involved in necessary rigorous assessments of GM foods (or any other foods) for allergic potential. The EPA, in fact, maintains an extensive list of foods that could trigger allergies. Another resource used to test for allergens is the University of Nebraska’s Allergen Online, which matches amino acid sequences of possible allergens with reference proteins [USER 152] to cause allergies. And, so far, no single biotechnology-based protein in food has been found to cause an allergic reaction.The causes behind the increase in food allergies are not [USER 152]. While anti-GMO groups have pointed to biotechnology, there are other proposed causes, each with a varying degree of data to support each.
Allergic reactions are complex. Even though eight foods cause most allergies, many more can cause specific reactions, because everybody’s intestinal, nervous and immune systems are different (not to mention their genetics). While certain genetically engineered experimental foods were found to have allergens, these allergens were [USER 152] and caught by researchers in early stages, just as a test on organic peanuts would also show a potential allergic reaction in sensitive people. And further studies have shown that transgenics technology does not make a food any more allergenic — but neither does it automatically make it less (unless the target trait is allergenicity)."

What is not tested, ever, for safety?? Organic, heirloom, hybrid and new truck farm breeds. They go straight to store shelves with [USER 112] testing and YOU are the guinea pig. Look at what has happened because of this fact that never happened with GMO foods: "A year ago[2003] in New Zealand, there was an outbreak of food poisoning from a "killer zucchini" that hospitalized a number of people. Environmentalists jumped all over the story until it was determined that the culprit was "organic" zucchini. Plants are chemical factories that produce a multitude of toxins that protect them. An outbreak of aphid infestation had minimal impact on conventionally grown zucchini. The more vulnerable "organic" zucchini was genetically inferior because of inbreeding. They expressed dangerously high levels of the toxin curcubitan. Had this been a transgenic plant, we would be hearing about it ad nauseum, but being that it was "organic," it was quickly consigned to an Orwellian memory hole." uh dot edu/~trdegreg/genetic_engineering_not_significantly dot htm

The US government and science institutions fund the studies. Fuck off with that corruption conspiracy theory bullshit. Pre-GMO safety testing standards, before our FDA, USDA & EPA started demanding 75+ tests on each new GMO before approval, the following happened: In the late 1960s, researchers from the US Department of Agriculture, Penn State University and the Wise Potato Chip Company collaborated to breed the “Lenape” potato. This new breed soon became hugely popular with potato chip manufacturers, due to the fact that it had the perfect combination of sugar and [USER 147] to produce the thin, crispy golden brown potato chips that we know today.
But the Lenape potato’s biggest legacy might be its impact on the GMO debate. After the new breed was introduced, the USDA found that it contained heightened levels of solanine, an alkaloid that helps protect the potato against pests that is also slightly toxic and harmful to humans.
The Lenape potato shows that risk and uncertainty is not just associated with genetically modified crops, but crops that come from conventional breeding as well. According to a new article on Boing Boing, “there’s actually a lot more risk and uncertainty with conventional breeding, than there is with genetic modification. That’s because, with GM, you’re mucking about with a single gene. There are a lot more genes in play with conventional breeding, and a lot more ways that surprising genetic interactions could come back to haunt you.” geneticliteracyproject dot org/2013/10/04/potato-chips-dangerously-delicious/ If you are a conspiratard who says the GLP put a spin on this, note they only reproduced the story from another site and they provide hyperlinks to more sources.

Hey everybody! Look at the RAVING LUNATIC 'Almost' trying to defend
SERALINI
, the most infamous and forever shamed fraud in crop science! What kid of blathering moron would try to defend a 7 year old retracted and fraudulent study??? To what end?
You are looking at the insane ramblings of a demented conspiratard. The often reproduced image of rats with large tumors came from the fake scientist fraud Seralini. How dishonest can you get? The Seralini quack has been completely debunked and ejected from the scientific community for his lies about GMOs and rats. For starters, he used a species of lab rat [USER 152] to always grow many tumors by age one no matter what it is fed! The EU launched a massive campaign 6 years ago to either verify or disprove all of Seralini's claims from his organic farmer funded fake lab in France. Results? Not a single claim could be verified or reproduced, all study methods were found to be extremely faulty and misleading. Seralini will go down in history as the top anti-GMO fraud of this century! geneticliteracyproject dot org/2019/02/20/seralini-pseudoscience-syndicate-lessons-learned-from-decade-long -assault-on-biotechnology-orchestrated-by-french-geneticist/

ALL READERS SEEING THIS - go to the actual NAS report to see this mentally ill lying sack of shit is cherry picking and distorting the wording of that huge historic NAS study that had a FAVORABLE report on GMOs, so favorable it ended the GMO safety debate forever and this became settled science. Note that no human safety testing is required or desired for GMO foods, risk and substantial equivalency is screened for up front before any GMO is approved for sale. Codex DOES NOT require human safety testing. Here is what this asshole does not want you to see - the link to the study. This channel blocks live links, the main reason this stupid motherfucker infects this thread. Just replace the 'dot' with real dots to make this link work: nas-sites dot org/ge-crops/2016/05/16/report-in-brief/ Their site has been upgraded with videos to explain the findings and facts that are free of the tyranny of organic foods lobbyist lies.

Hey everybody! Look at the RAVING LUNATIC trying to defend
SERALINI
the most infamous and forever shamed fraud in crop science! What kid of blathering moron would try to defend a 7 year old DOUBLE RETRACTED and fraudulent study??? To what end?
You are looking at the insane ramblings of a demented conspiratard. The often reproduced image of rats with large tumors came from the fake scientist fraud Seralini. How dishonest can you get? The Seralini quack has been completely debunked and ejected from the scientific community for his lies about GMOs and rats. For starters, he used a species of lab rat [USER 152] to always grow many tumors by age one no matter what it is fed! The EU launched a massive campaign 6 years ago to either verify or disprove all of Seralini's claims from his organic farmer funded fake lab in France. Results? Not a single claim could be verified or reproduced, all study methods were found to be extremely faulty and misleading. Seralini will go down in history as the top anti-GMO fraud of this century! geneticliteracyproject dot org/2019/02/20/seralini-pseudoscience-syndicate-lessons-learned-from-decade-long -assault-on-biotechnology-orchestrated-by-french-geneticist/

In 2016, before the EU inquiry buried Seralini forever the defamation suit was widely claimed as exoneration when it definitely was not. "No, Séralini’s research wasn’t vindicated by anyone, including the French Courts. The court did not, in any way, decide on the particulars of the research. It’s still bad. It’s still nonsense. It’s still badly designed. And it still does not show a link between GMOs and cancer. It still doesn’t overcome the problem that there’s simply no biological plausibility that genes from GMO foods could transfer itself to humans.
What the French court did do exonerate Séralini of committing fraud. Most of us who wrote about the Séralini Affair (yes, it’s a thing) did not accuse him of actual fraud.
Bad experimental design? Absolutely. Bad statistical analysis? Definitely. Bad conclusions? Undeniably." skepticalraptor dot com/skepticalraptorblog dot php/seralini-gmo-article-vindicated-by-courts-absolutely-not/
In the end the lawsuit decision was proven to be a gigantic blunder as the full extent of Seralini's hoax was revealed.

All readers - note the date of what he claims. AFTER that date and during the time the EU was evaluating all of Seralini's claims all those studies are permanently retracted as fraud. Note how this lying asshole totally ignores the full exposure and ejection from the scientific community of Seralini early in 2019!

All farming of every type is invasive to nature. GMO crops are actually less invasive because they require less pesticides of a less toxic nature and they grow more on less acreage, leaving more undisturbed land for carbon sequestration.

Almost totally insane repeats that false narrative about yields. GMO crop are NOT primarily created to increase yields, they are for reducing losses to pests and dealing with harsh conditions while requiring less pesticides of a less toxic nature. That's why the entire world now fully endorses the best crop science. The WHO, EPA, EFSA and 281 other agencies all say GMOs and glyphosate are totally safe and cause no unintended consequences. Full global consensus! All 284 global health and safety agencies agree. Yes, this is the mother of all GMO safety citations and a stake in the heart of all anti-biotech conspiratards: siquierotransgenicos dot cl/2015/06/13/more-than-240-organizations-and-scientific-institutions-support- the-safety-of-gm-crops/ On the linked page is a hyperlink of proof for each of those 284 agencies. Some may not be in English. Only the Russians and the IARC now discredited by bribery disagree. That NAS study does endorse GM crops unconditionally, that Almost liar asshole is cherry picking wording from a massive study that ended the GMO safety debate for all time.

A new study on the increase in the [USER 234] of farmers since GMO crop science has become wide spread:
Peer reviewed and published 27 September 2019
"GM crops, particularly Bt cotton, has resulted in significant reductions in pesticide poisoning cases due to reduced applications and reduced levels of insecticide exposure. Reductions in farmer pesticide poisonings have been quantified in China, India, Pakistan and South Africa. Often cases of pesticide poisoning are not formally reported to health centers and the results on pesticide poisoning may be underestimated due to the lack of reporting. In South Africa, farmers reduced pesticide applications from 11.2 per year to 3.8, with reported cases of pesticide poisoning declining from over 50 per year to less than 10 over the first four years of Bt cotton adoption (Bennet et al. 2003). One-third of non-Bt cotton farmers in China reported cases of pesticide poisoning, compared to 9% of Bt cotton producing farmers (Hossain et al. 2004). Assessing the health impacts in India, reveals a reduction in cases of pesticide poisoning of 2.4 – 9 million cases per year (Kouser and Qaim 2011). Cumulatively, since 2003, when Bt cotton was first commercialized in India, a minimum of 38 million fewer instances of pesticide poisoning have occurred, with an upper potential of 144 million. Farmers in Pakistan growing non-Bt cotton reported up to seven instances of pesticide poisoning in the growing season with 35% reporting no instances, versus Bt cotton farmers reporting up to six poisonings with 45% reporting none (Kouser and Qaim 2013). A medical assessment of 246 Chinese farmers, involving 35 health indicators, found that fungicides associated with the production of non-Bt cotton had linkages to damaged liver function, while the insecticides used in non-Bt cotton production may be associated with severe nerve damage (Zhang et al. 2016). The use of non-glyphosate tolerant crops was found to likely reduce renal function and decrease serum folic acid.
CHANGES IN FARMER SUICIDES
Mental health challenges and issues affect all walks of life and economic sectors, with agriculture being no different. Access to sufficient mental health resources can be problematic within the agriculture sector due to rural areas, remote locations and lack of access to mental health support systems. Unfortunately, suicide is a concern in agriculture. India has one of the highest suicide ratesin the world and research has examined the relationship between farmer suicide and the adoption of GM cotton. Research examining the relationship between farm suicide and Bt cotton adoption revealed a plateauing of the suicide rate following the commercialization of Bt cotton (Gruère and Sengupta 2011). Farmer suicides were trending upward from 15,000 per year, peaking in 2004, the year after Bt cotton
was first commercialized in India. By 2007, the actual suicide rate was 25% below the extrapolated suicide rate. Cumulatively, the reduced rate of suicide associated with the adoption of Bt cotton represents the prevention of a minimum of 75,000 farmer suicides.
LOWERING CANCER INCIDENCES
The development of insect resistant crop varieties has begun to have a noticeable potential to improve human health through the reduction of cancer rates. Prior to the commercialization of Bt crops, maize in particular, insect damage to the harvested crop increased the potential for the development of harmful health effects. A study of 21 years of maize production quantified that Bt maize contained lower concentrations of mycotoxins (29%), fumonisins (31%) and thricotecens (37%) (Pellegrino et al. 2018). Mycotoxins are both toxic and carcinogenic to humans and animals and are considerably more concerning in developing economy food systems where access to food safety toxicity tests are less prevalent. Fumonisins are correlated to being the cause of higher rates of neural tube defects in high maize-based diets (Missmer et al. 2006). With food security challenges existing in many developing countries corn containing mycotoxins are consumed as part of the household diet due the lack of any other option.
NUTRITIONAL BENEFITS
GM crops have made significant contributions to address the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, in particular goals one (reducing poverty) and two (reducing hunger). While increased yields have contributed to higher household incomes, which reduces poverty, the increased yields have also enhanced household food security. Biofortified GM crops have been adopted, increasing micronutrient availability (Hefferon 2014). Nutritionally enhanced foods improve an individual’s nutrient intake, preventing and/or treating leading causes of death such as cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and hypertension. Improving the nutritional content of daily food consumption certainly has day to day effects, but of significant importance are the long term effects that extend for decades over the course of an individual’s lifetime. In many instances, improving macronutrients (proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, fiber) and micronutrients (vitamins, minerals, functional metabolites) has significant childhood health improvements, such as reducing blindness due to the lack of vitamin availability. Improved food nutrient content, especially the increase in mineral availability, contributes to improved immunity systems and reduces stunting. In many developing countries, plant-based nutrient intake accounts for one hundred per cent of an individual’s nutrient diet, further highlighting the importance of nutritionally enhanced crop derived foods. As the later in life benefits from improved childhood nutrition are better understood, the full value of nutritionally enhanced GM crops and foods, may not be realized for several decades." see the full paper at onlinelibrary dot wiley dot com/doi/epdf/10 dot 1111/pbi.13261

Research examining the relationship between farm suicide and Bt cotton adoption revealed a plateauing of the suicide rate following the commercialization of Bt cotton (Gruère and Sengupta 2011). Farmer suicides were trending upward from 15,000 per year, peaking in 2004, the year after Bt cotton
was first commercialized in India. By 2007, the actual suicide rate was 25% below the extrapolated suicide rate. Cumulatively, the reduced rate of suicide associated with the adoption of Bt cotton represents the prevention of a minimum of 75,000 farmer suicides.
LOWERING CANCER INCIDENCES
The development of insect resistant crop varieties has begun to have a noticeable potential to improve human health through the reduction of cancer rates. Prior to the commercialization of Bt crops, maize in particular, insect damage to the harvested crop increased the potential for the development of harmful health effects. A study of 21 years of maize production quantified that Bt maize contained lower concentrations of mycotoxins (29%), fumonisins (31%) and thricotecens (37%) (Pellegrino et al. 2018). Mycotoxins are both toxic and carcinogenic to humans and animals and are considerably more concerning in developing economy food systems where access to food safety toxicity tests are less prevalent. Fumonisins are correlated to being the cause of higher rates of neural tube defects in high maize-based diets (Missmer et al. 2006). With food security challenges existing in many developing countries corn containing mycotoxins are consumed as part of the household diet due the lack of any other option.
NUTRITIONAL BENEFITS
GM crops have made significant contributions to address the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, in particular goals one (reducing poverty) and two (reducing hunger). While increased yields have contributed to higher household incomes, which reduces poverty, the increased yields have also enhanced household food security. Biofortified GM crops have been adopted, increasing micronutrient availability (Hefferon 2014). Nutritionally enhanced foods improve an individual’s nutrient intake, preventing and/or treating leading causes of death such as cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and hypertension. Improving the nutritional content of daily food consumption certainly has day to day effects, but of significant importance are the long term effects that extend for decades over the course of an individual’s lifetime. In many instances, improving macronutrients (proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, fiber) and micronutrients (vitamins, minerals, functional metabolites) has significant childhood health improvements, such as reducing blindness due to the lack of vitamin availability. Improved food nutrient content, especially the increase in mineral availability, contributes to improved immunity systems and reduces stunting. In many developing countries, plant-based nutrient intake accounts for one hundred per cent of an individual’s nutrient diet, further highlighting the importance of nutritionally enhanced crop derived foods. As the later in life benefits from improved childhood nutrition are better understood, the full value of nutritionally enhanced GM crops and foods, may not be realized for several decades." see the full paper at onlinelibrary dot wiley dot com/doi/epdf/10 dot 1111/pbi.13261

[USER 235 NAME] is correct. Bt is only a naturally occurring soil bacteria. It is heavily used by organic farmers. Conspiratards like Loic Daniel make shit up about biotech because they do not understand it. This is also called genetic illiteracy. Loic is lying and he is quoting highly hostile activists who only want to sell more organic foods by fear mongering. Bt eggplant has increased the incomes of Bangladesh farmers six fold as they no longer buy so much pesticides and their crops are perfect with no insect damage, making it easy to sell. Bt eggplant has been the main diet of their country for 5 years now with no negative health effects of any kind and many positive effects.

A new study on the increase in the [USER 234] of farmers since GMO crop science has become wide spread:
Peer reviewed and published 27 September 2019
"GM crops, particularly Bt cotton, has resulted in significant reductions in pesticide poisoning cases due to reduced applications and reduced levels of insecticide exposure. Reductions in farmer pesticide poisonings have been quantified in China, India, Pakistan and South Africa. Often cases of pesticide poisoning are not formally reported to health centers and the results on pesticide poisoning may be underestimated due to the lack of reporting. In South Africa, farmers reduced pesticide applications from 11.2 per year to 3.8, with reported cases of pesticide poisoning declining from over 50 per year to less than 10 over the first four years of Bt cotton adoption (Bennet et al. 2003). One-third of non-Bt cotton farmers in China reported cases of pesticide poisoning, compared to 9% of Bt cotton producing farmers (Hossain et al. 2004). Assessing the health impacts in India, reveals a reduction in cases of pesticide poisoning of 2.4 – 9 million cases per year (Kouser and Qaim 2011). Cumulatively, since 2003, when Bt cotton was first commercialized in India, a minimum of 38 million fewer instances of pesticide poisoning have occurred, with an upper potential of 144 million. Farmers in Pakistan growing non-Bt cotton reported up to seven instances of pesticide poisoning in the growing season with 35% reporting no instances, versus Bt cotton farmers reporting up to six poisonings with 45% reporting none (Kouser and Qaim 2013). A medical assessment of 246 Chinese farmers, involving 35 health indicators, found that fungicides associated with the production of non-Bt cotton had linkages to damaged liver function, while the insecticides used in non-Bt cotton production may be associated with severe nerve damage (Zhang et al. 2016). The use of non-glyphosate tolerant crops was found to likely reduce renal function and decrease serum folic acid.
CHANGES IN FARMER SUICIDES
Mental health challenges and issues affect all walks of life and economic sectors, with agriculture being no different. Access to sufficient mental health resources can be problematic within the agriculture sector due to rural areas, remote locations and lack of access to mental health support systems. Unfortunately, suicide is a concern in agriculture. India has one of the highest suicide ratesin the world and research has examined the relationship between farmer suicide and the adoption of GM cotton. Research examining the relationship between farm suicide and Bt cotton adoption revealed a plateauing of the suicide rate following the commercialization of Bt cotton (Gruère and Sengupta 2011). Farmer suicides were trending upward from 15,000 per year, peaking in 2004, the year after Bt cotton

You are right but you are a sub set of the greater group that had an adequate science education in grade school and we respect science. The real issue for the last 32 year has been this - "Although GMOs are regarded as safe as their conventional counterparts by every major food safety authority in the world, the organic industry spends nearly $3 billion a year through over 330 different organizations leading with fear and “information spin” as an industry to sell their products. By creating an unfounded fear that requires tighter regulations on GMO crops, they are hoping to force them out of the food supply, thereby creating a bigger market share to sell more products in their more than $65 billion wheelhouse.
The unfortunate consequence of these [non-GMO] labels is that the food companies and lobbyists tend to create an unnecessary “us vs. them” divide. When food companies use fear against competitors to sell a product, farmers take it personally."

GMO is a laboratory breeding method for seeds. It is never under any circumstances an actual food ingredient just as hybridization, grafting and seed selection are not food ingredients Lying organic thug trolls will try to use fear mongering to convince you GMO sourced foods are not as safe when in fact they are far safer. What is not tested, ever, for safety?? Organic, heirloom, hybrid and new truck farm breeds. They go straight to store shelves with [USER 112] testing and YOU are the guinea pig. Look at what has happened because of this fact that never happened with GMO foods: "A year ago[2003] in New Zealand, there was an outbreak of food poisoning from a "killer zucchini" that hospitalized a number of people. Environmentalists jumped all over the story until it was determined that the culprit was "organic" zucchini. Plants are chemical factories that produce a multitude of toxins that protect them. An outbreak of aphid infestation had minimal impact on conventionally grown zucchini. The more vulnerable "organic" zucchini was genetically inferior because of inbreeding. They expressed dangerously high levels of the toxin curcubitan. Had this been a transgenic plant, we would be hearing about it ad nauseam, but being that it was "organic," it was quickly consigned to an Orwellian memory hole." uh dot edu/ ~trdegreg/genetic_ engineering_not_significantly dot htm

'Almost' JUST POSTED HIS 142nd BLATANT BALD FACED LIE ABOUT HUMAN SAFETY TESTING. THIS IS REFUTATION NUMBER 142 COMPLETE WITH HYPERLINKS OF PROOF THAT PROVES THE '[USER 89]' TROLL IS LYING FOR THE 142nd TIME: Human safety feeding trials study, including quantified human risk assessment, that trolls say do not exist: Golden rice is designed to make a change in the human body with Vit. A. This is an exception to most GMO foods so Codex compliant human testing was done. Here is the study that verified the human safety and nutrition trials: ncbi dot nlm dot nih dot gov/pmc/articles/ PMC2682994/ Note that only one serving per person was required to verify the proper nutrition from golden rice. Additional servings would be a waste of time, as determined by multiple safety agencies who peer reviewed the process.
"So "why don't we do clinical trials on GMOs the same way we do for drugs?" Drugs are designed to cause a change in the human body: that's the whole point behind them. Since drugs are altering something in humans, it's important to know the side-effects that they may cause and whether or not they're causing the anticipated effect (i.e. is it better than placebo). In contrast, GMOs are designed to be equivalent to their non-GE counterparts: they aren't drugs or nutritional supplements." geneticliteracyproject dot org/2016/01/13/ no-long-term-gmo -studies-humans/

Shill shill shill just makes you look like a blathering idiot and forfeits every time, the win goes to science truth. The shill gambit failed debating tactic is explained simply in the dictionary of your choice.

That is a lie. The precautionary principle is part of the guidelines of all safety agencies. So is the mandate of substantial equivalency. No GMO will ever be approved if it does not qualify as equivalent to its non-GMO counterpart and all must pass over 75 mandatory tests required by the EPA, FDA & USDA. This takes years to complete and millions of dollars of investments, hence the need for 20 year patents to protect the investments. GMO safety is so fully established globally that 284 global health and safety organizations endorse it plus the safety of glyphosate. The WHO, EPA, EFSA and 281 other agencies all say GMOs and glyphosate are totally safe and cause no unintended consequences. Full global consensus! All 284 global health and safety agencies agree. Yes, this is the mother of all GMO safety citations and a stake in the heart of all anti-biotech conspiratards: siquierotransgenicos dot cl /2015/06/13/more -than-240-organizations-and-scientific -institutions-support-the-safety-of-gm-crops/ On the page is a hyperlink of proof for each of those 284 agencies. Some may not be in English. Only the Russians and the IARC now discredited by bribery disagree.

Vitamin A is always vitamin A. Once it has been proved to be absorbed from rice the same as it has from hundreds of other foods there is no further study needed. Suggesting it need more study as a SUGGESTION ONLY at the end of a study is just researchers looking for more work. The mentally ill Almost idiot is fucking stupid.

Bt gmo technology is now being use in Europe as in all over the world. Organic growers have used Bt for decades even injecting some food with Bt. I am sure you have heard of Bt corn. Bt corn contains naturally occurring Bacillus thuringiensis bacteria, a result of recombinant DNA techniques. that selectively kill caterpillar pest. Organic growers have for decades approved sprays containing Bt, a naturally occurring soil bacterium. Bt produces biotoxins lethal to moths,caterpillars and butterflies when ingested. Because it targets these insects' intestinal membranes(ABSENT in HUMANS and ANIMALS ), the EPA considers it benign to non- caterpillar species, including beneficial insects. When Organic growers spray Bt they kill all moths,caterpillars, and butterflies but we do not do that with gmo corn because only corn bore and corn rootworms attacks corn so they are the only insects affected. For 80 years farmers like me used dangerous dangerous pesticides to control theses insects but today we do not have to use them thanks to gmo technology. GMO technology is safer for my children, my Wife, our water, our farm, and our environment. WE and YOU should give thanks to almighty GOD for the wisdom of GMO Technology.

Total ignorance from your poor education's science illiteracy. If they were 'poison' you could easily link us examples of humans or animals who were poisoned and died. You would find may unbiased non-activist videos about specific cases of poisoning documented by main stream qualified doctors and food scientists here at Youtube. This has never happened even once in all history you asshole. You can not locate and link or paste a coroner report or autopsy that documented death by GMO.

Yes, the Youtube idiocracy prefers sensationalism to real science which is too slow for their short attention spans. That's why cartoons are so popular. This is where the idiocracy comes to feed.

All readers - if you do a search for the phrase this liar claims is a quote, it does not exist on the internet. See for yourself - post part or all of the words he claims are a FAO policy quote in the search page of your choice- "4) First, despite what is sometimes said, we do not need GMOs to resolve the current world hunger
problem. There is enough food for everybody, but millions of people are poor and simply do not have the money to buy food – that is why access to food is a major problem." NOTHING WILL BE FOUND!!! Flag this malicious asshole.

Farmers in the developing world are crying for such traits as Bt corn, and the Bt trait to be allowed in other crops.
Bangledesh is proving to be a leader in the developing world having commercialized Bt brinjal. Farmers love Bt crops as it allows insecticide sprays to be dramatically reduced.

Ha!!! They are light years BEHIND!! Every time they try stone age farming methods they have to declare a crop emergency, the last one was when they stupidly tried to ban neonicotinoids without an acceptable substitute. What those who do not have a mind closed by willful ignorance see is that EU nations DO grow GMO crops. Spain grows all its own GMO animal fodder. The rest of the EU hypocritically imports thousands of metric tons of US grown GMO grains ever year, they are our largest customer. We also see that in the last year the total number of countries with GMO cultivation bans has dropped from 37 to 29 as African nations crawl out of the stone age. Your campaign of hatred against modern crop science is failing. Hate speech has been causing too many shootings lately. You could cause assholes to burn or vandalize farmer's fields, or worse. Stop.

Your post is false. Bt gmo technology is now being use in Europe as in all over the world. Organic growers have used Bt for decades even injecting some food with Bt. I am sure you have heard of Bt corn. Bt corn contains naturally occurring Bacillus thuringiensis bacteria, a result of recombinant DNA techniques. that selectively kill caterpillar pest. Organic growers have for decades approved sprays containing Bt, a naturally occurring soil bacterium. Bt produces biotoxins lethal to moths,caterpillars and butterflies when ingested. Because it targets these insects' intestinal membranes(ABSENT in HUMANS and ANIMALS ), the EPA considers it benign to non- caterpillar species, including beneficial insects. When Organic growers spray Bt they kill all moths,caterpillars, and butterflies but we do not do that with gmo corn because only corn bore and corn root worms attacks corn so they are the only insects affected. For 80 years farmers like me used dangerous dangerous pesticides to control theses insects but today we do not have to use them thanks to gmo technology. GMO technology is safer for my children, my Wife, our water, our farm, and our environment. WE and YOU should give thanks to almighty GOD for the wisdom of GMO Technology.

There is no danger. GMOs are only grown inside the fences of farms where biodiversity MUST be controlled. Monocropping is far more efficient. OUTSIDE of the farms all diversity continues as always and no plant goes extinct when a new GMO is sold. GMOs can only add to total diversity on the planet. There are always seed banks and vaults, and hobby farmers growing older less popular species. GMO science can be used specifically to create virus resistant strains. It has saved the Hawaiian papaya and is now reviving the Florida citrus crops. There is far more than one single species of any particular GMO crop so there is diversity in seeds available. It's all good, we are far better off than we were 50 years ago.

All reports are routed to the USDA, FDA & EPA for review and food recalls are based on this scrutiny. Their websites all have form for reporting concerns or you can call them. Ask Almost how he was treated when he called the FDA and blathered demented lies in their ears. He can't even remember what he did yesterday!!

Your post is False [USER 261]. The rate of Roundup(Glyphosate) used per acre has been the same for 45 years. We do not use more per acre. We do not keep adding more nitrogen but on proper amounts to raise record crops. If you grew up on a farm then you know farmers take great pride in their soil and replace everything the crop needs to produce bountiful crops. The soil provides their living and income. You obviously did not learn much growing up on the farm.

Absolutely NOT a 'bandaid', this is the front line of a full on global effort for survival. The rear echelon is the thousands of other technological advances that reduce the need for fossil fuels, from LED lighting to battery technology to solar and wind power. Just look at the 160 pound car-bike I drive as shown in my avatar - it is solar and pedal powered [USER 112] emissions. The Impossible burger movement is another aspect.

You are a fucking moron!! We want humans to simply reduce the birth rate and stop breeding like bunnies. No environmentalist anywhere wishes death on living beings, we wish a better quality of life on the living beings. Nor are we anti-technology. We are only anti-fossil fuels. YOUR LIES AND HOSTILE IGNORANCE IS EVIL AND AN ENEMY OF ALL LIFE ON EARTH. Climate change is a separate but connected topic. In a world with no human caused climate change we would still be enviromentalists wanting humans to live in greater harmony instead of causing species extinctions.

No it does not. Only freshness affects flavors. When GMO and organic versions grown under the same condition and soils are each picked at the peak of ripeness and tasted immediately there is no difference. It is handling and picking prematurely to get produce to market before it goes bad that lowers flavor. You pay extra for organic woo so they have no excuse to not pick it closer to ripeness.

No seed company can add a thing to crops, farmers and only farmers do that. Farmers create the demand that companies only fulfill. No seed company has ever sold a single ounce of food at groceries. GMO is just a breeding method, never an actual ingredient just as seed selection, hybridization and grafting are breeding methods. You use the word 'narrative' when you wish to place a negative connotation on video content. There is nothing wrong or inaccurate here.

That's a blatant lie asshole. No GMO is ever released for sale before years of highly monitored testing. Yes, YEARS AND EVEN DECADES pass before any new GMO is allowed to be sold. All readers here now clearly you see you are an insane ranting asshole liar. If David sold "death", WHERE ARE THE BODIES??? WHERE ARE THE CORPSES?? WHERE are the autopsies and coroner reports and massive national news coverage of a deadly plague of deaths by poisoning?? They are lodged firmly UP YOUR ASS.

No there are many diseases that barely alter the appearance of fruit, in some cases it is environmental factors or insect bites that make the skin less than perfect looking while doing nothing to the flavor, or it may just reduce the total yield of the mango tree. There are no serious mango plagues right now, any GMO projects would be to give them a longer shelf life or more flavor or a smaller pit. Imagine a tiny pit instead of the huge ones that are almost half the weight of the fruit, requiring more inedible skin to cover it all. Imagine a tasty skin that we don't need to peel before eating. Avocados with smaller pits area already being enjoyed.

No, adaptive changes can become apparent in just a couple generations. Swallows living in NYC tunnels developed shorter wings quickly. Crop pests can begin to adapt in the second year of growing the same crop with the same pesticides. That's why rotation is considered essential.

It was Pepsico not McD. The potatoes are not GMO potatoes, they are a variety that Pepsico spent millions of dollars and years to develop. Pepsico contracts with thousands of Indian farmers to grow them and when those four other farmers grew them without permission Pepsico took action.
How can you blame them for taking action against farmers who steal their property please?
"GMOs are very welcome if the corporations are NOT allowed to have a say on who controls the yield." What does that mean?

Patents are a fact of life. Not accepting them means you do not accept [USER 91]. The only reason you have computer, smart phone, flat panel TVs, internet and access to advanced medical care is because of patents. We'd still be an undeveloped country without patents. Ever since the US Plant Breeders Protection Act of 1931 we have granted organic, hybrid, conventional and GMO patents for highly desirable seed that can take years and millions of dollars to create. ALL PATENTS EXPIRE after 20 years. FARMERS DO NOT WANT TO REPLANT HYBRID SEEDS!!! Farmers quit saving Hybrid seed in mid 1930's and as each crop became a hybrid farmers quit saving seed from that crop because replanting loses the desired traits. It is illegal to save patented seed and does not mater if it is GMO or non GMO seed. Farmers are law abiding citizens but some think they are above the law. If you save seed do not buy patented seed to do so. A first grade child can understand that. There are many companies even foreign companies producing and selling GMO technology seed. That favorite whipping boy Monsanto was bought out and when it did exist it only controlled 20% of the GM seed market globally. All patents expire 20 years from the date they were filed. GMO soybeans are off patent open source now and are a bargain for farmers at the permanently lower price.

Your post are False. Organic Use MANY toxic pesticides. Bt gmo technology is now being use in Europe as in all over the world. Organic growers have used Bt for decades even injecting some food with Bt. I am sure you have heard of Bt corn. Bt corn contains naturally occurring Bacillus thuringiensis bacteria, a result of recombinant DNA techniques. that selectively kill caterpillar pest. Organic growers have for decades approved sprays containing Bt, a naturally occurring soil bacterium. Bt produces biotoxins lethal to moths,caterpillars and butterflies when ingested. Because it targets these insects' intestinal membranes(ABSENT in HUMANS and ANIMALS ), the EPA considers it benign to non- caterpillar species, including beneficial insects. When Organic growers spray Bt they kill all moths,caterpillars, and butterflies but we do not do that with gmo corn because only corn bore and corn rootworms attacks corn so they are the only insects affected. For 80 years farmers like me used dangerous dangerous pesticides to control theses insects but today we do not have to use them thanks to gmo technology. GMO technology is safer for my children, my Wife, our water, our farm, and our environment. WE and YOU should give thanks to almighty GOD for the wisdom of GMO.

You are misinformed. All GMO seed in the US is tested for years, average 13 years before release in the US. Independent is not required, all 3 of our agencies mandate a total of over 75 tests before FDA, USDA & EPA approval. Crisper science will shorten this average time but all countries, with no exceptions, have mandatory testing even when a GMO has been proven safe for years or even decades previously in other countries. Both golden rice and GMO salmon had over 20 years to get past all the hurdles. US voters elect the officials who oversee the FDA and our agencies frequently open up issues to public comments. Broaden your narrow view. - look who is AVAILABLE to fill highly specialized positions at the FDA. Walmart greeters and gas station attendants won't cut it.

This part of your comment is false Aperture, "Furthermore, Monsanto (oh boy) is notorious for suing organic farmers that have Monsanto GM crops in their farms.
Problem is, the crops are in their farms because Monsanto GM foods spread through seeds unintentionally, it's not the farmers' fault, but since Monsanto modified seeds are literally trademarked by Monsanto and treated as proprietary property, they get screwed over."

You are genetically illiterate. Peer reviewed science IS the closest thing to perfection humans can achieve. Nobody ever did what you claimed, we mostly use gene segments from similar species and animal gene segments for crops are very rarely done, a fish gene segment to prevent freezing damage is a typical example, it is a few codes out of the 3 billion plant code segments. Nature put a bacteria gene in the sweet potato 13,000 years ago, it does happen and the world does not end because natural selection never stopped working. We have full control of these crops. There are no wild stands of corn, soy or sugar beets. Since we didn't go anywhere there is no reason to try to go back. Your education was a failure.

No. That is a lie and a very ignorant opinion not based on the truth. GMO crop science is a kind of crop science discipline. It is not a living thing and can not "make" anyone do anything. Intelligence and education LETS smart people and companies exercise their PRIVILEGE to invest millions of dollars and years of research to come up with a new seed that farmers really want, protected by a patent to shield their investment from pirates and the Chinese thieves. The same US patent laws gave you the internet, digital conveniences, microwave ovens, a longer life span and the Avengers. All patents expire after 20 years. There are many other species of corn that were never patented and all humans are free to plant those whenever they want. The smart farmers want to pay a bit extra and get the best seed.

No type of seed has been lost, you should be catching a clue by the fact that farmers prefer the best GMO seed and eagerly line up to buy it. GMO seed to address specific climate change challenges is already being given away free and there is a lot more on the way.

You more facts? Ok, your claim that "Monsanto generically modifies their crops to make them MORE resistant to glyphosate. More resistance means more Roundup, more RoundUp means more glyphosate, and more glyphosate means more cancer."
Crops are enginee[USER 86] to be resistant to glyphosate, not to be "more resistant" to withstand more roundup. There is not a trait for "more resistance". Please provide the direct evidence of that trait.
Yes, those rulings by the jury mean nothing. Juries are not qualified to decide complicated questions of science and ended up deciding on sympathy and emotion. Not a single regulator or agency in the world has found glyphosate to be carcinogenic.
I am not pro-Monsanto as glyphosate has not been under the control of Monsanto since it went off patent almost 20 years ago. A couple of dozen companies have been making it since then too. What I do is follow the data no matter where it leads and it says that a safe and beneficial product is being unfairly attacked.

No you are making many arbitrary assumptions. Evolution never tailors a food for us, we made do with what evolution provided until we tamed fire, then all bets were off. As we used and abused technology to increase population to dangerous levels we had no choice but to alter all foods we eat for maximum benefits. We have been dong this for 10,000 years and GMOs are nothing new. Your logic failure is that if "everything is good as it is" then we have to accept a much shorter life span and die younger, we have to accept diseases as is and not battle epidemics. Life does not work that way for us now. This changed forever when we tamed fire. There is no longer such a thing as 'natural' foods except for what we hunt and fish.

Natural selection has never stopped working. Very fast is the best possible outcome, that will mean feeding more with less acreage. In fact the newest GMO seed research has a goal of being perennial, meaning they don't die off and have to be replanted each year. A farmer's dream.

[USER 298], the Golden Rice cultivar GR2R is the one you mention. It has been long left behind by GR2E which overcame the low yield problem and the low beta carotene expression and should be released free to poor farmers in Asia in the next year or two. Regards.

Natural selection never stops, not even in a GMO crop field. Farmers may save the seed from the plants that survive pests the best and plant those. Hot chilies are a natural pesticide, pests have not overwhelmed and become resistant to hot peppers. The burn is savored by billions of humans too.

A peer reviewed paper on GE trees: "Intensively managed, highly productive forestry incorporating the most advanced methods for tree breeding, including the application of genetic engineering (GE), has tremendous potential for producing more wood on less land. However, the deployment of GE trees in plantation forests is a controversial topic and concerns have been particularly expressed about potential harms to the environment. This paper, prepared by an international group of experts in silviculture, forest tree breeding, forest biotechnology and environmental risk assessment (ERA) that met in April 2012, examines how the ERA paradigm used for GE crop plants may be applied to GE trees for use in plantation forests. It emphasizes the importance of differentiating between ERA for confined field trials of GE trees, and ERA for unconfined or commercial-scale releases. In the case of the latter, particular attention is paid to characteristics of forest trees that distinguish them from shorter-lived plant species, the temporal and spatial scale of forests, and the biodiversity of the plantation forest as a receiving environment."

Now to make it even more confusing for the uneducated our new US GMO disclosure law will not use 'GMO', they call it GE to defuse the fear mongering the organic thugs tried desperately and dishonestly to connect with the best crop science. Obama correctly blocked all those state GMO labeling laws shoved down our throats by organic lobbyist thugs. Next the FDA will crack down on that 'Non GMO verified' label nonsense that has resulted in GMO free labels on sea salt and hundreds of foods that have no GE equivalent.

Not really. You need to know that as long as humans have used pesticides we have seen pest resistance be a challenge any time we don't employ regular crop and pesticide rotations schedules. This was a challenge for hundreds of years before the first GMO was planted. Pests can only develop resistance by their successive generation adaptations( evolution in action) and when we foil that by presenting different deterrents and rotating crops they are foiled. No crop has magical effects on the genes of other organisms.

You are an idiot for ignoring the fact that all our safety agencies monitor our crops constantly to verify no pesticide residue is present above the established conservative safety limits of 30 ppm. And Glyphosate breaks down in soils by microbial action. It passes harmlessly through the human body through our excretions and it can not bio-accumulate.

Thank goodness FDA and EPA testing of foods no longer finds dangerous levels of Atrazine, paraquat, DDT, fludioxonil, metolaclor, acephate and diazinon. Now they find minute traces of the least toxic herbicide ever formulated, glyphosate, which is 43% less toxic than table salt, and Bt, so non-toxic that organic farmers rely on it heavily. WHAT A DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENT!!!! Anti-GMO idiots claim they want to go back to that nightmare list of much more toxic pesticides. Why???? I can't imagine.

ALL PATENTS EXPIRE after 20 years. GMO soybeans are generic and cheap now, a bargain for farmers. FARMERS DO NOT WANT TO REPLANT HYBRID SEEDS!!! Farmers quit saving Hybrid seed in mid 1930's and as each crop became a hybrid farmers quit saving seed from that crop. We have had patented seed ever since Congress passed the Plant Variety Protection Act in 1970 Protecting Plant Breeders with patent rights. It is illegal to save patented seed and does not mater if it is GMO or non GMO seed. Farmers are law abiding citizens but some think they are above the law. If you save seed do not buy patented seed to do so. A first grade child can understand that. There are many companies even foreign companies producing and selling GMO technology seed. That favorite whipping boy Monsanto was bought out and when it did exist it only controlled 20% of the GM seed market globally. All patents expire 20 years from the date they were filed. GMO soy is off patent open source now and is a bargain for farmers at the permanently lower price.

False. Less than half of all GMO seed created today is from for-profit efforts. NGOs and government seed programs create beneficial seed to deal with fast changing climate conditions and those are given away free. The for-profit businesses have to compete and every single GMO ever created has been tested for years by safety agencies before approval. A 20 year patent gives them time to recoup multi-million dollar development costs, then it becomes open sourced and cheaper, a bargain for farmers. This happened to GMO soybeans 5 years ago and will happen with every GMO seed on the market today. You do not grasp [USER 91].

You are extremely ignorant on this topic. They do not "whither every year" any more than organic, heirloom or conventional crops so that is a lie. Farmers are still free to save their seeds but they know that by buying fresh hybrid seed every year they reap huge yields. Hybrid seed has never been saved and replanted without losing the desirable traits. The GMO version called Bt will only kill very specific borer worm pests and NO OTHER LIVING THING! This saves farmers the time and cost of spraying toxic pesticides and is a fantastic benefit the whole world is adopting. And the ultimate irony is that there is now research to create perennial crops that do't need replanting every year, achieving exactly what you incorrectly claimed was a fault. This would be a first, great for the environment and a boon to farmers everywhere.

Entirely separate subjects. I'll bet that if you had read the warnings and side effects sheet that came with the drug you used, that possibility was mentioned. All drugs sold have potential rare side effects, key word 'rare' which is how they get FDA approval through trials before going to market. Rare side effects are deemed not sufficient reason to hold back drugs that could help so many and improve the quality of life for most who need them. If your side effect was not listed your responsibility was to report to the FDA through your doctor. In comparison, GMO seed has to go through much more strict tests that take years to complete and ANY side effects at all would ban the seed from sales. Your thought process shared here is illogical. EPA,USDA & FDA mandate over 75 tests before approval, substantial equivalency and any allergens are at the top of the list.

What you 'think' is not valid. Facts are valid. I never share my personal thoughts because the bounty of real factual data and studies is huge. You can google GMO safety testing for each of the agencies I mentioned to see I am correct and you are wrong. You don't even know the US has a GMO labeling law signed by Obama in 2016 and starting use this year, in full enforcement by 2020. GMOs are superior now and will be [USER 109] 30 years from now. All patents expire after 20 years so the seed becomes cheap and generic. Better versions are being tested now. New science makes GMO seed faster, cheaper and more precise.

No idiot, 10 seconds on google would have set you straight. Instead you went off half cocked here and made a fool of yourself. Advanced traditional diploid and triploid breeding creates seedless. Every seedless field has to have seeded versions there to pollinate the seedless flowers. GMOs are created in laboratories. Only 4 GMO fruits are sold in markets.

False. There are no "glyphosate ridden" crops anywhere. Over half of all GMOs today are NOT glyphosate tolerant. Herbicides are expensive to buy and apply. Farmers use very tiny amounts, just 10 dry ounces per 500 gallons of water per acre. Then all crops are monitored regularly by EPA and FDA tests to assure glyphosate is not present above the legal limit of 30 ppm. That established safety limit includes a 100X margin for error. We DO use as little glyphosate as possible and farmers are very careful. You are suckered by organic thugs who spread lies about GMOs to sell more crappy inferior organic foods. Thank goodness FDA and EPA testing of foods no longer finds dangerous levels of Atrazine, paraquat, DDT, fludioxonil, metolaclor, acephate and diazinon. Now they find minute traces of the least toxic herbicide ever formulated, glyphosate, which is 43% less toxic than table salt, and Bt, so non-toxic that organic farmers rely on it heavily. WHAT A DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENT!!!! Anti-GMO idiots claim they want to go back to that nightmare list of much more toxic pesticides. Why???? I can't imagine.

Plant roots have always waged underground chemical warfare with their neighbors. This is not an issue inside the borders of a farmer's field where fields are planted with a single plant. Outside his fences, there would be no change in balance if some escaped. They are all subject to survival of the fittest, as always.

I thought the video was clear - The GMO Bt trait is extremely specific and targeted. The protein is identical to what is found in soil bacteria. There are many millions of proteins and each will only bind to a specific molecule in an organism. Bt only affects a few species of borer worm pests and no other plant or animal. Pollinators are completely unaffected and they are safer than in fields sprayed with a pesticide. Even organic farmers rely heavily on the Bt protein toxin.

Eduardo is an extremely ignorant science illiterate fool. He does not even realize that there is no such thing as 'natural' for the last 11,000 years since humans started breeding all their plants and animals. Easy example - wild wolves are natural but no dogs we have are natural, they were all the result of breeding wolves for preferred traits. Same with all foods we eat, only the original 2 inch long bitter white wild carrots are 'natural'. The FDA is now considering making the word 'natural' illegal on all food packaging because it misleads uneducated consumers like Eduardo. LOCAL FARMERS grow GMO seed, they demanded better seed and they got it from the seed corporations who have never sold a single bite of food to anyone. There is no "handcuffing" of any kind, all farmers have the choice at all times to buy only the seed they desire. Eduardo should stop insulting our honest hard working farmers who are ever so much smarter than him.

No, sorry, that can not happen and never has. You got bad information from anti-science activists secretly trying to sell more organic foods by fear mongering. Or you just misunderstood. The common myth is that weeds build resistance to glyphosate more, or differently, that they do with other herbicides. That is false, any pest can build a resistance to any pesticide when farmers fail to use the established proven practice of crop and pesticide rotation to block resistance build-up. This was a know problem all farmers dealt with regularly for decades before the first GMOs were approved and planted. Rotation also keeps soils richer.

Your post is false and ignorant. There many companies even foreign companies producing and selling gmo technology seed. There are many companies even foreign companies producing and selling pesticides. Farmers quit saving seed in the mid 1930's with the development of hybrids and as each crop over time was developed into a hybrid farmers quit saving seed from that crop. The reason farmer choose to use gmo technology seed is so they can use much less and much safer pesticides even safer than many of the pesticides organic growers use. Farmers keep their soils in top shape setting yield records almost every year. Bayer is not even number one in gmo technology seed sales.

1) half of all GMO seed planted today is provided free of charge from NGOs and government programs, but profit is never a fault. Do you work for free?
2) food wasted in this country can never be transported half way around the world, past corrupt governments and soldiers, to those who need it the most.
3) the fact that we have always altered food and animal DNA for our benefit is a very good thing, essential for survival now with a 7.6 billion population.
4) GMO foods taste NO DIFFERENT and all blind taste tests prove it. Best taste is always the result of letting food ripen 100% on the vine for eating immediately after picking. Only ignorant fools say otherwise.
5) you talk stupid and are never right.

That is coorect you need to read on the topic because your post is False. Bt gmo technology is now being use in Europe as in all over the world. Organic growers have used Bt for decades even injecting some food with Bt. I am sure you have heard of Bt corn. Bt corn contains naturally occurring Bacillus thuringiensis bacteria, a result of recombinant DNA techniques. that selectively kill caterpillar pest. Organic growers have for decades approved sprays containing Bt, a naturally occurring soil bacterium. Bt produces biotoxins lethal to moths,caterpillars and butterflies when ingested. Because it targets these insects' intestinal membranes(ABSENT in HUMANS and ANIMALS ), the EPA considers it benign to non- caterpillar species, including beneficial insects. When Organic growers spray Bt they kill all moths,caterpillars, and butterflies but we do not do that with gmo corn because only corn bore and corn root worms attacks corn so they are the only insects affected. For 80 years farmers like me used dangerous dangerous pesticides to control theses insects but today we do not have to use them thanks to gmo technology. GMO technology is safer for my children, my Wife, our water, our farm, and our environment. WE and YOU should give thanks to almighty GOD for the wisdom of GMO.

How can an adult not know that there is global evidence of plant and animal breeding by humans dating back over 13,000 years? In some cases we have actually tested DNA remnants in grains to see how far along they were. The fossil record proves we have bred all domestic dogs from wolves.

Harold - how the heck does your mind make the jump from plant breeding to human genome tampering? Again, you post as though you have been in a cave away from all media and reference materials for a lifetime. Do you live in a religious cult?The huge controversy about the BRAND SPANKING NEW FIRST EVER USE of GMO Crispr technology on a human baby last year in China was announced repeatedly around the world and is currently the subject of heated debate in most media in existence. The US is now formulating the content of new laws to prevent that and highly regulate any research on human genetic tampering. Obviously the only GMO to ever improve (by eliminating a deficiency) the human body uses vitamin supplementation. Golden rice took over 25 years to develop and get approval and it is now approved for importing and use in 5 countries. Bangladesh is planting its first crops this year to eliminate cases of blindness and stunted growth from Vit. A deficiency.

Thank goodness [not a daddy in the sky] FDA and EPA testing of foods no longer finds dangerous levels of Atrazine, paraquat, DDT, fludioxonil, metolaclor, acephate and diazinon. Now they find minute traces of the least toxic herbicide ever formulated, glyphosate, which is 43% less toxic than table salt, and Bt, so non-toxic that organic farmers rely on it heavily.

False. Anti-science activists funded by the high price of organic foods have conducted a 32 year long disinformation campaign. They lied to you. There is no proven negative effect of GMO foods. Remember that GMO is never an actual ingredient, it is a breeding method. GMO seeds grow plain old food, but they do it better which is why farmers prefer it. Real peer reviewed studies find no effect on our microbiome.

False. It is illegal to sell any seed or produce that has "lost all nutrients and become bad for health". Every GMO today has had to pass over 75 demanding safety and equivalency tests mandated by our FDA, USDA & EPA. This has taken an average of 13 years for approval and patenting. There are no unbiased peer reviewed studies anywhere that prove the slightest negative health effect from GMO foods. If there was, those seeds would be recalled as all hazardous foods always have been in the US. Idiot!

One reason only - store tomatoes and all other produce have to be picked green to avoid rotting before they get to store shelves. No GMO tomato has been sold for 15 years, anywhere. Pick your yard tomatoes green, refrigerate them for 5 days, fumigate them for pests, rinse in edible wax solution and the smell will be identical.

It is more complex than that. Bt is one of 20 million proteins. Each one bonds with only one specific molecule and humans have no body chemistry the Bt protein can bind to or affect. Borer worms are the only life form affected by Bt. Stomach acids have nothing to do with Bt, you are thinking of the DNA in all foods, including GMO foods, that are rendered by stomach acids.

It is not. You are lying. Flavor of feed corn and GMO soybeans is only sensed by farm animals, humans don'teat that. There are only 10 GMO crops grown in the US and half are cattle feed or cotton. Only 3 fresh produce items are GMO - zucchini, yellow squash and Hawaiian papaya. Every single food in the fresh produce section depends on being picked at peak ripeness for the best flavor. That is impossible when it has to be transported and travel through a distribution system before you get it. The taste of organic or GMO produce is identical when both have been picked at peak ripeness. most importantly, there is virtually no GMO produce consumed by you. Seedless is not GMO, there are no GMO citrus fruits and the one GMO apple for sale is being used in dried snack packs only. There are no GMO grapes, carrots or greens at this time.

Monoculture is an entirely separate topic. It was practiced for hundreds of years before the first GMOs were planted. Monoculture is the most efficient and productive farming method, resulting in less land needed to be cleared of trees. Varieties found in markets have always been in a state of change and farmers try newer breeds that yield more per acre and last longer on shelves, or resist pests better. Increased spoilage and waste went along with the varieties you claim you preferred in the past but note that all seeds ever planted in the last 100 years or more have samples preserved in seed banks and vaults so noting is actually lost. Plant breeders are extremely aware of the demand for more flavor and are always working for new varieties, particularly strawberries for which there are new more tasty strains being tried right now.

No, no GMO foods are used to vaccinate any humans. That is an extremely odd comment. Tomatoes and potatoes are not common in tropical zones, they grow taro and yucca and other starchy root vegetables or bananas for starchy staples. There are no GMO tomatoes anyway. Trying to slip vaccines into foods would start a global riot the likes of which humanity has never seen before.

The fact is that the food industry is policing itself and sets preferences to buy palm oil from certified sustainable palm oil plantations.

There is simply no connection between GMO crop science and palm oil except in the most broad sense that all farming of every sort, including organic, is invasive to nature.

The number one fraud was banned last year, [USER 355] Adams. But new disgustingly fake news videos are posted every day here by Jeffry Smith, [USER 356] Berg, Gary Null and a hundred more. Ignorant house wives and even school kids post bullshit they read on activist sites, they don't know any better and too many teachers are not showing them how to do searches correctly. God is helping us by the permanent end of G+ comments on April 2nd. After that date no asshole like you can suggest more lies about crop science in Youtube comments. GMOs are great you moron fukwit.

Only quack fraud fakers here on Youtube, wearing a lab coat to fool you(and you WERE fooled) claim there is any safety issue with GMO foods. You need to look up the definition of peer reviewed research and smell the coffee, 11,000 studies from around the world all agree GMO foods and glyphosate are safe. You are just a sucker for organic farmer thugs.

It is already proven 100% safe redundantly. GMO foods are one of the most heavily studied topics in science. Enhancing the product is not desirable except in the case of vitamin enhanced golden rice. What is enhanced is the farmer's ease, cost and impact of growing the food by greatly reducing pesticide use, water use and fertilizer required.

Youtube comments include barely literate users who have no idea how the commenting system works. Examples I run across every day:
1) They don't know you can expand down the video description directly under each video to learn more about it or to find citation links provided by the video creator.
2) They don't even realize the
Read more
addition at the end of all comments longer than 4 lines will expand out the full comment they are seeing or are replying to.
3) Some have no idea they can edit their comments or delete them by conveniently provided buttons G+ provides.
4) Some post an entirely new comment at the top of a thread just to reply directly to an existing days old comment because they don't notice or recognize the "reply" button each comment has at the bottom. Imagine the ineptitude!
5) Some don't realize a blue font color means they are seeing an active link in a video comment! And many more are so close to total computer illiteracy that they have no basic skills to post a hyperlink that might prove some point they are trying to make.
6) Many of the most ignorant foolish comments you see here were completely avoidable if the idiot spent 30 seconds doing a google search to verify the sometimes bizarre notions they post.
7) When they have no refutation to a point and they have no logical argument they may play the shill card, claiming you are some sort of paid operative. This is called 'poisoning the well' and is a childish form of trying to cheat to win, it is an automatic forfeit of the debate.

All GMO genetic codes are already existing in nature. We just gift useful code segments to plants that will work to our advantage. Nothing is made up from scratch. No "corporate control" can extend beyond 20 years for each GMO seed because patents expire. GMO soybeans have been off patent, generic and a bargain for farmers now for 5 years. This happens to every seed eventually if they were patented with the intention to sell them but in fact half of all GMO seed created today is by non-profit NGOs and governments who give the seed away free to struggling farmers. So much for your ignorance based 'corporate control' bullshit. What happens in an infinite number of scenarios that will never happen? Nobody of any consequence cares. All genetically literate educated adults know how every GMO seed must pass a rigorous demanding regimen of at least 75 tests required by our USDA, FDA & EPA. NOW YOU ARE AWARE OF THAT AND CAN NO LONGER CLAIM IGNORANCE.

No, that's wrong too for the following reason: Thank goodness FDA and EPA testing of foods no longer finds dangerous levels of Atrazine, paraquat, DDT, fludioxonil, metolaclor, acephate and diazinon. Now they find minute traces of the least toxic herbicide ever formulated, glyphosate, which is 43% less toxic than table salt, and Bt, so non-toxic that organic farmers rely on it heavily. WHAT A DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENT!!!! Anti-GMO idiots claim they want to go back to that nightmare list of much more toxic pesticides. Why???? I can't imagine.

Oh god no! It would be the single worst disaster since we mass produced cars, to extend life spans that long. How dare you be so selfish! We all get our time here and then have to move on to make room for the next generation. I am saying this forcefully because your comment failed to include the required behavioral change to never reproduce unless we actually need population growth. What we need most is responsible people to vow to never reproduce and let their family lines die off. Only then would longer life and an end of suffering to existing populations be acceptable. Yes I made that vow 30 years ago, kept it, and have willed my modest estate to Planned Parenthood. I repeat, you are an unmitigated disaster of extremely hubristic selfishness.

Sorry but you are in a fantasy world far removed from [USER 91]. THIS world is where we are and THIS world is being trashed fast NOW by over population. This is not a science fiction movie, we absolutely do not have the resources and may never have the technology to migrate and dwindling resources due to over population make your fantasy less likely every day. Remember that even in a fantasy world there is no reason to leave a perfect world for an unknown one if we don't trash what we have now. Crop science may be able to feed us ONLY if we stabilize population and that is impossible if the rich can buy themselves an abnormally long life in the ultimate selfish act.

I was challenging his notion that we can just pick up and move to another world. But all educated people know the blatantly obvious, that extending live spans without reducing population would be a disaster beyond the current disaster we have now.

The EPA and FDA use LD50 toxicity tables as the basis for establishing safe daily dietary intake of each pesticide. In the case of glyphosate the amount is 1.3 parts per million which includes an extreme over kill safety margin for error of 100X. All foods sold in or entering the US are tested for compliance. You can literally eat 80 times the calculated maximum safe legal content of glyphosate in your food every day for an entire lifetime with no negative health effects. Yes it is that safe.

There are no risks, period. You are a sucker of organic foods cartel disinformation to sell more organics by fear mongering, This video will entertain no such lies or anti-science sentiment. The exact opposite of what you posted is in fact true, gene editing today is vastly more accurate and 10 times faster by using CRISPR technology. Look it up. We now get exactly the mutation we desire the first time whereas in the past we had to sort through hundreds of mutations in a lab to find the exact trait we desired, then spend years of testing to prove it is good. Over 75 tests mandated by USDA, FDA & EPA must all be satisfied before any GMO is approved and patented. These facts make you look ridiculous.

There are no "GMO induced toxins". Again you are making up malicious lies. Bt is the only thing closed to a toxin but it is simply a reproduced protein that is already widely present in soil bacteria Bacillus theuringensis.

You are a bit confused - farmers do not want genetic diversity in their crops, that is counter productive. Diversity is vital OUTSIDE the borders of a farm's fences. All seeds ever grown by humans have preserved viable samples in seed banks and vaults. We have learned a lot since the Irish potato famine, what happened then can not happen again. GMOs are much more resistant to blights and we have excellent pesticides to instantly treat any blight that shows up. ONLY 30% of "all cash crops" are GMO. 90% of COMMODITY crops are GMO, a huge difference when clarified. Animal feed, cotton and ethanol corn = most GMO crops. There are over 1000 varieties of bananas, many hobby farmers in Florida and central and South America have all these examples to breed and refine. No one particular banana is perfect or ideal. A new GMO golden banana is about to be released in Uganda to deal with vitamin A deficiency that causes blindness.

There is only one GMO that targets an insect. It is producing a very specific protein that occurs naturally in a soil bacteria, Bacillus theuringensis. Organic farmers consider this extremely safe and use it heavily, meaning it is likely popular in your own country. There are many millions of proteins that only react with very specific cells like a highly complex key fitting a complex lock. The lock in this case is the stomach lining of a few species of borer worm pests. Bt is totally benign to all other life. You can't grow corn or cotton without attracting the pests that thrive on it. Remember that science is never about what we think, or our opinions or feelings, only proven facts are relevant.

The mechanism by which some commodity drops repel insects is the Bt protein toxin. Without it millions of acres of crops would be lost in just one week and we would have a national crop emergency, the largest one in all human history. It is far too expensive to grow, process and spray a million gallons of teargas (hot pepper juice) when a far better and safer and precisely targeted effect is achieved by the Bt toxin.

A common meme we all hear if we are exposed to lying activist sites and videos is that the Monsanto boogeyman and "corporations" want to "control the world's seed supply". Let's ponder that for a moment which is all it takes to realize how absurd and ignorant that meme really is. All the corporate seed companies combined comprise less than 20% of our global seed supply. A partial list of the plethora of supply sources they can never touch: free NGO and government run seed programs, seed banks and vaults, seed exchanges, seed libraries, neighbors swapping seed, farm granges, online seed sales, small local farm supply stores, gardening supply stores, collecting seed from wild sources, countries like Mexico where GMO seed is rejected, China with its own GMO and conventional seed programs, Asshole Russia with their anti-GMO troll armies, seed saving practices, remote villages who never have and never will buy seed, and mountain terrace farmers at the ends of 200 kilometer long foot paths in mountainous regions of three continents. Are corporate seed sellers going to march jack booted thugs up those paths with packs full of seed they will force the remote villages to buy?? Myth busted!

Thank goodness FDA and EPA testing of foods no longer finds dangerous levels of Atrazine, paraquat, DDT, fludioxonil, metolaclor, acephate and diazinon. Now they find minute traces of the least toxic herbicide ever formulated, glyphosate, which is 43% less toxic than table salt, and Bt, so non-toxic that organic farmers rely on it heavily. WHAT A DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENT!!!! Anti-GMO idiots claim they want to go back to that nightmare list of much more toxic pesticides. Why???? I can't imagine.

[USER 395] Roundup is a herbicide and ALL herbicides are pesticides. I would never use Roundup on waterways or drains. The label will tell you what it will control and if anyone has any brains they would know not to use it on waterways for sure. I have been using Roundup ever since it came out as a non selective herbicide. So was a farmer your boss? Did your boss tell you not to wear safety gear? A lot of people who were around 245t have had health issues and one of the reasons it is not used in this country.

How long have you been asleep [USER 397]. Monsanto was bought two years ago. They only sue farmers when they break the law something any seed company will do. You are clueless about this subject. There are many companies even foreign companies producing and selling gmo technology seed. Farmers are not aloud to save patented seed to plant both non gmo and gmo technology seed. We have had patented seed since Congress passed the Plant Variety Protection Act in 1970 Protecting Plant Breeders with Patented Rights. Any seed company will sue you if you break the law ans save patented seed to plant. Farmers quit saving seed in the mid 1930's with the development of hybrids and as each Crop was developed into a hybrid farmers quit saving seed from that crop. You really need to get an education on this subject [USER 397] before you start spewing out your ignorance.

I see you are clueless on this subject. We have had patented seed both non gmo and gmo every since Congress passed the Plant Variety Protection Act in 1970 Protecting Plant Plant Breeders with Patented Rights. Farmers quit saving seed in the mid 1930's with the development of hybrids and as each crop was developed in a hybrid over time then farmers quit saving the seed from that crop. There are many companies even foreign companies producing and selling gmo technology seed. Farmers around the world overwhelmingly freely choose gmo technology seed when it is an option. Do you why?

Yes I have. Can you name the crops that use gmo technology? Is Monsanto the only word you know? Do you know anything about Bt? GMO technology is about farmers like me using much much less pesticides and much much safer pesticides with the pesticides even safer than many of the pesticides that Organic growers use. The CBS Evening News had a piece 8-30-2017 on how gmo technology was being use to cure some cancers. They showed exactly how is being done and they are also working on other cancers trying to cure them. Man has been breeding plants in all different ways for thousands of years to help benefit mankind. 500 years ago a carrot was pure white. GMO technology is use in many things to better the world. Almost all Insulin used today by diabetics is GMO insulin. GMO rennet has been used for decades to make cheese. The cheese making enzyme breaks down proteins and separates them from whey. Golden Rice to benefit vitamin A-deficient children. & BT CORN AND COTTON. GMO proteins include blood- clotting factors to help Hemophiliacs, the hepatitis B vaccine, thyroid hormones, laundry detergent enzymes, and many synthetically produced amino acids used in nutritional supplements. There are many many many more benefits of GMO technologies. We all should give thanks to GOD for giving us the wisdom of GMO and stand up to those that tell lies about GOD's blessings trying to play GOD themselves trying to take away his blessings.

GMO technology is use in many things to better the world. Almost all Insulin used today by diabetics is GMO insulin. GMO rennet has been used for decades to make cheese. The cheese making enzyme breaks down proteins and separates them from whey. Golden Rice to benefit vitamin A-deficient children. & BT CORN AND COTTON. GMO proteins include blood- clotting factors to help Hemophiliacs, the hepatitis B vaccine, thyroid hormones, laundry detergent enzymes, and many synthetically produced amino acids used in nutritional supplements.

Not answering the simple questions proves your ignorance on this subject. You do not eat Bt corn!! You eat food grade corn which is always non gmo. Can you name another Bt crop that you consume. There is more Bt in some Organic crops that are in GMO technology Bt crops. Bt is harmless and used all over the world. You can keep posting to keep proving your ignorance on this subject if you like [USER 470 NAME]. The rate per acre of glyphosate has always been the same. Do you know what that rate is [USER 470 NAME]? If more and more acres of Roundup ready crops are being planted then more total Roundup(Glyphosate) will be used.

There is no such chemical as "glycophosphates".

Bayer is free to use the brand name "Roundup" in any way it chooses. It can call vinegar a glyphosate free version of Roundup. That does not mean it will work like glyphosate.

Every farmer since 1930 knows about seed patents and willingly sign the contract to use them and know that they cannot plant the resulting seeds. GM row crops were not planted until 1996 and every farmer already knew not to plant the resulting seeds.
Some did and Monsanto filed 150 lawsuits over 24 years against the seed stealers. That's out of millions of customers in that time frame and they donated the proceeds to local charities.

NO Glyphosate is NOT sprayed directly on your food. Glyphosate is a very very safe herbicide used 3 to 4 months before the crop is harvested. Can you name the gmo technology crops that can NOT have Glyphosate used on them? There are many many many many herbicides that Farmers could choose to use on their gmo technology crops. Glyphosate is by far the safest of them all a a big reason it is very popular with them. There are mant companies even foreign companies producing and selling Glyphosate. Monsanto's patent ran out in 1999.

Yes The Chinese purchased Syngenta. GMO technology is about farmers like me using much much less pesticides and much much safer pesticides with the pesticides even safer than many of the pesticides that Organic growers use. The CBS Evening News had a piece 8-30-2017 on how gmo technology was being use to cure some cancers. They showed exactly how is being done and they are also working on other cancers trying to cure them. Man has been breeding plants in all different ways for thousands of years to help benefit mankind. 500 years ago a carrot was pure white. GMO technology is use in many things to better the world. Almost all Insulin used today by diabetics is GMO insulin. GMO rennet has been used for decades to make cheese. The cheese making enzyme breaks down proteins and separates them from whey. Golden Rice to benefit vitamin A-deficient children. & BT CORN AND COTTON. GMO proteins include blood- clotting factors to help Hemophiliacs, the hepatitis B vaccine, thyroid hormones, laundry detergent enzymes, and many synthetically produced amino acids used in nutritional supplements. There are many many many more benefits of GMO technologies. We all should give thanks to GOD for giving us the wisdom of GMO and stand up to those that tell lies about GOD's blessings trying to play GOD themselves trying to take away his blessings.

There are no Super Weeds! Can you name a super weed? Please do not name a weed that glyphosate never controlled. There are NO super weeds and there are no weeds we can not control. Farmers have fought herbicide resistance for years and years. This not new to farmers but only to uneducated people on this subject. NO herbicide ever controlled all weeds. Glyphosate never controlled all weeds. Your post is ignorant and makes no sense and your links are garbage. Farmers could choose between many many many many many different herbicides to use on their gmo technology crops but NONE are as safe as glyphosate. Can you name one that is safer? Glyphosate is even safer than many of the pesticides organic growers use. Why would you want farmers to go back to using more and more harmful pesticides? When you see people in the cities control their dandelions you know they just used Dicamba a very old herbicide. Your posts tell me that your knowledge on this subject is ZERO.

You have not answered anything because you know nothing about this subject. GMO technology is about farmers like me using much much less pesticides and much much safer pesticides with the pesticides even safer than many of the pesticides that Organic growers use. The CBS Evening News had a piece 8-30-2017 on how gmo technology was being use to cure some cancers. They showed exactly how is being done and they are also working on other cancers trying to cure them. Man has been breeding plants in all different ways for thousands of years to help benefit mankind. 500 years ago a carrot was pure white. GMO technology is use in many things to better the world. Almost all Insulin used today by diabetics is GMO insulin. GMO rennet has been used for decades to make cheese. The cheese making enzyme breaks down proteins and separates them from whey. Golden Rice to benefit vitamin A-deficient children. & BT CORN AND COTTON. GMO proteins include blood- clotting factors to help Hemophiliacs, the hepatitis B vaccine, thyroid hormones, laundry detergent enzymes, and many synthetically produced amino acids used in nutritional supplements. There are many many many more benefits of GMO technologies. We all should give thanks to GOD for giving us the wisdom of GMO and stand up to those that tell lies about GOD's blessings trying to play GOD themselves trying to take away his blessings.

Organic growers use their toxic pesticides that are much much worse than Roundup clear up until harvest.

You are correct. Even Organic Growers use pesticides and some are toxic.
https://www.geneticliteracyproject.org/2015/12/07/myth-busting-on-pesticides-despite-demonization-organic-farmers-widely-use-them/
I am a 66 year old farmer born and raised on the farm. As a farmer we pay more for gmo seed but in return use way way less pesticides. Organic Growers for decades have used Bt even injecting food with Bt. I am sure you have heard of bt corn. Bt corn contains naturally occurring Bacillus thuringiensis bacteria, a result of recombinant DNA techniques. that selectively kill caterpillar pest. Organic growers have for decades approved sprays containing Bt, a naturally occurring soil bacterium. Bt produces biotoxins lethal to moths,caterpillars and butterflies when ingested. Because it targets these insects' intestinal membranes(ABSENT in HUMANS and ANIMALS ), the EPA considers it benign to non- caterpillar species, including beneficial insects. When Organic growers spray bt they kill all moths,caterpillars, and butterflies but we do not do that with gmo corn because only corn bore and corn root worms attacks corn so they are the only insects affected. For 80 years farmers used dangerous dangerous pesticides to control theses insects but today we do not have to use them thanks to gmo. GMO;s are safer for my children, my Wife, our water, our farm, and our environment. WE and YOU should give thanks to almighty GOD for the wisdom of GMO.

Out of all those herbicides Roundup is by far the safest herbicide of them all. It is sad that so much misinformation gets spread by those that should know better. Man has been breeding plants in all different ways for thousands of years to help benefit mankind. 500 years ago a carrot was pure white. GMO technology is use in many things to better the world. Almost all Insulin used today by diabetics is GMO insulin. GMO rennet has been used for decades to make cheese. The cheese making enzyme breaks down proteins and separates them from whey. Golden Rice to benefit vitamin A-deficient children. & BT CORN AND COTTON. GMO proteins include blood- clotting factors to help Hemophiliacs, the hepatitis B vaccine, thyroid hormones, laundry detergent enzymes, and many synthetically produced amino acids used in nutritional supplements. There are many many many more benefits of GMO technologies. We all should give thanks to GOD for giving us the wisdom of GMO and stand up to those that tell lies about GOD's blessings trying to play GOD themselves trying to take away his blessings. If you have any questions I will glad to help.

Roundup. If you take all your household cleaners and put them on your kitchen table and a gallon of Roundup. The Roundup will most likely be the safest thing on the table. Roundup was originally developed as a soap over fifty years ago. Roundup has a toxicity level one half of regular table salt it is that safe. It is the only one out of many many many herbicides that Farmers purchase that he does not have to have a Pesticide License to be able to purchase. Roundup has no soil activity and you can plant anything you want where it has just been sprayed. Unlike other herbicides there will be no trace any where in soil of Roundup after six weeks. Because weeds GMO themselves Roundup does not kill a lot of weed species today like it did when farmers started using as a herbicide. Every year farmers use less Roundup and have had to turn to newer herbicides that work better but are not quite as safe as Roundup.

More lies from the professional LIAR. NO seed company do the things you and your look very ignorant with your post. There are many seed companies producing and selling gmo technology seed. Monsanto was no. 2 in gmo seed sales. I say was because Monsanto has been bought out. Is Monsanto the only word you Know? GMO technology seed is use around the world and farmers overwhelmingly FREELY choose to purchase and grow gmo technology seed. Why do farmers freely choose to use gmo technology seed around the world?

He says there is no research! GMO crops are safe to eat, based on decades of research by European Commission Joint Research Centre, the American Medical Association, the National Academy of Science, and the World Health Organization. GMO crops are as safe as crops derived from traditional breeding methods, according to a European Union review of more than 25 years of research representing thousands of independent studies, The European Union, which strictly regulates GMO crops, concluded that "biotechnology, in particular GMO's are not more risky than conventional plant breeding technologies.

Almost all insulin used by diabetics today is made from genetically modified cells(GMO). Before genetic engineering(gmo), diabetics injected insulin extract from pig and cow pancreases. Some diabetics had allergic reactions to insulin from animal pancreatic tissue. through genetic engineering(gmo), the insulin gene from humans is inserted into bacteria. the bacteria act as miniature factories, pumping out an insulin protein identical to human insulin.This insulin is then used for human medcal purposes today. Hint the answer to previous question has something to do with protein.

Bt corn (gmo) is naturally occurring bacillus thuringiensis bacteria, a result of recombinant DNA techniques, that selectively kill corn pest. Organic growers have for decades approved sprays containing Bt(Bacillus thuringiensis bacteria. They spray it over the Whole crop killing every insect.

Organic certification does not equal zero presence of a gmo. Low level presence of gmo in organic production is allowed as long as the grower has followed the organic process for organic production. Organic crops with gmo presence can and are sold as organic. The USDA certification does not have a zero policy.

If you know anything about gmo you can answer this simple question. Have you ever wondered why certain insects only attack one plant.

Sorry but not only am I an expert on GMO, I am a farmer that plants and raises gmo crops. They are safer for me, my children, and the environment. I do not have to use dangerous harmful pesticides like we use to in the past because of gmo crops. I live out here and we drink the water out here. Most people don't even know that most plants gmo themselves all the time with out man's help. Farmers can only plant 80 percent of each field to a gmo crop because it is so safe that weeds and insects will gmo themselves and will not be bothered by it. All other nations but one have tested and imported a record amount of our grain. South America produces more gmo crops than we do. China buys one half of our soybean crop every year. In this case true science will win out over ignorance.

The often reproduced image of rats with large tumors came from the fake scientist fraud Seralini. How dishonest can you get? The Seralini quack has been completely debunked and ejected from the scientific community for his lies about GMOs and rats. For starters, he used a species of lab rat known to always grow many tumors by age one no matter what it is fed! The EU launched a massive campaign 6 years ago to either verify or disprove all of Seralini's claims from his organic farmer funded fake lab in France. Results? Not a single claim could be verified or reproduced, all study methods were found to be extremely faulty and misleading. Seralini will go down in history as the top anti-GMO fraud of this century!

They showed exactly how is being done and they are also working on other cancers trying to cure them. Man has been breeding plants in all different ways for thousands of years to help benefit mankind. 500 years ago a carrot was pure white. GMO technology is use in many things to better the world.

Vicki - Monsanto, the favorite whipping boy of the anti-science conspiracy theorists, had nothing whatsoever to do with making the Bt cotton seeds or planting them or watching them grow so much better than the local cotton with no resistance to the bollwevil. Smart Indian farmers accomplished this and there isn't a fucking thing you can do about it, the video will remain up along with dozens more in the Hindi language as Indian farmers share their information and success with GE seed. HERE is a video of a Kenyan corn (maize) grower praising its high performance with low pesticide usage, also NOT "Monsanto" products:

Roundup is not an endocrine disrupter.
Roundup does not inhibit nitrogen fixing.
Roundup does not lock up minerals in the soil.
If any of that were true soils would be dead by now since roundup has been used since 1974. Farmers are not idiots Rich.

I guess you're not aware that in vitro cell lines studies are meaningless to make that determination [USER 551 NAME]. In vitro cell line studies are headline grabbers which you dutifully grabbed onto.
Not a single OECD 453 compliant study has found any harm of any type from glyphosate below the NOAEL including being an endocrine disrupter.
Not genotoxic, not hepatotoxic, not carcinogenic, not teratogenic, etc.
And since our exposure to glyphosate is magnitudes below the NOAEl, and magnitudes below the RfD we can rest easy.
As in many things it is the dose of a thing that makes it a poison, not the mere presence of the thing.

Glyphosate is ONLY 'poison' to weeds with the cellular shikimate pathway. No human or animal or insect has that. All foods are in fact monitored by the EPA and FDA for safe levels of pesticides. It is easy to avoid exceeding the safe daily maximum exposure limit of 1.3 parts per million, which itself has a 100X safety margin for error on the safe side. For example, you can eat foods every day of your life that contain 80 times the safe legal limits of glyphosate with no effect to your health. In reality the legal limits are rarely ever exceeded and when they are, it is only by a small percentage which is detected and recalled.

[USER 565] - Agreed, we don't need poisons, that is why it is so important to use glyphosate, the least toxic herbicide ever formulated. It is other pesticides and excess fertilizers, not glyphosate, that fouls water and kills fish with algae blooms. Since organic practices provide only 1% of all our foods, this is extremely important to the vast majority of farmers globally. Approved organic pesticides are much more nasty, the comment from peter above was not honest. He did not tell you abut the nasty list of approved 'natural' source pesticides permitted under the organic standard. They are much much worse than glyphosate:

Your post is False. Roundup (Glyphosate) is known as a non-selective herbicide and considered to be fairly harmless to the environment, food sources and animal life. It works on most persistent weeds and its main active ingredient is glyphosate. Glyphosate is an acid but for the application in Roundup it is presented as its potassium salt. The amount in the solution is 5.5 lbs. per gallon. Roundup is a post-emergent herbicide, which means you apply it when the weed is growing. The glyphosate targets the EPSP synthase, a key enzyme plants need to make amino acids, a crucial building block of their cells. Without the ability to make amino acids, the plant cells starve to death. The herbicide penetrates foliar structures, such as leaves, but does not penetrate woody stems or trunks, which makes it safe to spray around trees. Glyphosate quickly breaks down into naturally occurring carbon dioxide and nitrogen, rendering it harmless.

They agreed that Glyphosate is the safest herbicides that farmers have ever used. In fact the LD 50 number which is the ratings used all the world to measure toxicity with the HIGHER the number the LOWER the toxicity.

Out of many many many herbicides that farmers can use on gmo crops GLYPHOSATE is by far the SAFEST of them ALL. Can you name one herbicide that is safer than GLYPHOSATE?

ALL herbicides and even pesticides Organic growers use adjuvants. Even Roundup when it was on the market for the first few years was just just Glyphosate without an adjuvant in it. You then decided which one you wanted to use with it. Many farmers buy generic glyphosate and choose which adjuvant to use with it because it is much cheaper and there are many companies even foreign companies producing and selling glyphosate and adjuvants. Roundup(Glyphosate) been proven not to cause cancer and a big reason farmers freely choose it to use. Your post continues to show just how clueless you are on this subject Almost. Glyphosate(Roundup) Is the only herbicide you can name out of the many many many many farmers could choose from. Your ignorance is pitiful Almost.

I am glad you finally got the message that Glyphosate(Roundup)is by far the safest herbicide farmers have ever used even much safer than many of the highly toxic pesticides organic growers use. you finally learning Almost. There are many many many herbicides farmers like me could choose to use and if you think there is one of them that might be safer than glyphosate(Roundup) please don't be bashful and let me know.

That is correct Glyphosate(Roundup) does NOT cause cancer and is the safest Herbicide farmers have ever used. The IARC which a division of the World Health Organization which is what you are talking about said in March of 2015 that Glyphosate was probably a carcinogenic. They also said that beer, coffee, cell phones, aloe vera, pickled vegetables, fried chicken, and sunlight were also probably carcinogenic. They agreed that Glyphosate is the safest herbicides that farmers have ever used. In fact the LD 50 number which is the ratings used all the world to measure toxicity with the HIGHER the number the LOWER the toxicity. To show how low a toxicity Glyphosate has here are some examples. Nicotine 9 caffeine 192 Tylenol 338 Codeine 427 2-4-D 665 OFF for mosquitoes 1014 Table salt 3000 Vinegar 3300 Baking Soda 4220 Roundup(Glyphosate) 5600.
Out of many many many herbicides that farmers can use on gmo crops GLYPHOSATE is by far the SAFEST of them ALL. Can you name one herbicide that is safer than GLYPHOSATE? Glyphosate is even safer than many of the pesticides that Organic growers use. Glyphosate is applied at specific rate and no more just like all the other herbicides that Farmers use.

No, it was absolutely not mixed bred. He selected for the GM canola [USER 580 NAME]. Since you do not know what selected for means, it means that he sprayed roundup on the canola and the plants that didn't die meant they were GM. He saved those seeds and kept planting them until in the third growing season he had enough for 1,000 acres of GM canola.

If you love it so much, why don’t you marry it?
Who doesn’t remember this ridiculous line from their childhood? The schoolyard taunt was directed at a whole array of things that one might be inclined to defend – best friends, the teacher, or your favorite color crayon. Normally, or hopefully, most people grow out of such childish taunts when they reach an adult age and start to mature.
.... Most people, but not anti-GMO morons.
Apparently that isn’t necessarily true for anti-GMO activists and, unfortunately, one interviewer used such a taunt against a respected scientist while he was attempting to promote Golden Rice. The now infamous YouTube video shows a short clip of an interview with Dr. Patrick Moore, where he states that glyphosate does not cause cancer and that you could drink a quart of it without it hurting you. The interviewer then mocks Dr. Moore by offering him a glass of glyphosate to drink. Realizing the interview is a sham, Dr. Moore ends the interview and walks off camera.
The video clip launched the attack by anti-GMO activists of Dr. Moore and anyone supporting genetic modification – if glyphosate is so safe, then why don’t you drink it? Naturally, activists also alleged that Dr. Moore was a paid Monsanto lobbyist.

I had your number before the first time you ever heard of GMO crop science. "The shill gambit is a type of ad hominem or poisoning the well logical fallacy, wherein one party dismisses the other’s argument by proclaiming them to be on the payroll of some company.
Sometimes known as the Big Pharma Shill Gambit or the Monsanto Shill Gambit. The shill gambit is used fallaciously when the only “evidence” given of such a connection to a big company or government is the endorsement of the position of the government or company, without any other evidence–the implication is that they provide that endorsement only because they receive some sort of compensation from the company or other agency. On the other hand when such conflict of interest is both demonstrated by verifiable evidence and can be shown to interfere with a person’s judgement of the evidence, then it’s no longer a logical fallacy.
Example -
Clearly, anything the writer says about pharmaceuticals or GMOs can be dismissed because, even though I can’t prove it, they are obviously being paid by Monsanto and Big Pharma to spread the lies." This despite the fact that Monsanto shut down forever in 2017!!!

GMO 20-year safety endorsement: 280 science institutions, more than 3,000 studies
"Currently, there is a social and political controversy about the safety of foods produced from genetically modified (GM) crops. However, in the scientific community, there is no dispute or controversy regarding the safety of these crops. To date, more than 3,000 scientific studies [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8] have assessed the safety of these crops in terms of human health and environmental impact. These studies together with several reviews performed on a case-by-case from regulatory agencies around the world have enabled a solid and clear scientific consensus: GM crops have no more risk than those that have been developed by conventional breeding techniques.
In addition, there is also extensive literature that compiles the socioeconomic and environmental benefits that transgenic crops have reported in two decades of commercialization [9,10].
This document brings together the public statements of technical and scientific institutions that adhere to this consensus. I made an update based on this document from ChileBio that initially included 40 official documents representing about 190 institutions – the document from ChileBio was subsequently updated in 2017 with the institutions and statements attached here.
The update shows that 284 technical and scientific institutions recognize the safety of GM crops and their potential benefits. Interestingly a large part of these institutions are located in Europe, the continent that has put more obstacles to the commercialization of these crops. On the other hand, the countries with most organizations in favor of GM crops are United Kingdom (33), United States (25), Italy (23), Spain (16) and Germany (11).
In conclusion, 284 technical and scientific institutions recognize that GM crops are not riskier than those produced by conventional breeding, and/or the potential benefits of these crops."

For the record, global hunger has been cut in half in the last 50 years. It continues to drop as we get better at increasing production with the same land area thanks to use of fertilizer, farm machinery and modern crop science. Our rate of population growth continues to decelerate. GMO crop science is half way to obsolescence already as CRISPR gene editing enters its 7th year. There will be something even better after that.

Risk-Monger channel - thanks for this very good documentary of the positive benefits of GMO crops. This is a thorn in the side of anti-biotech activists everywhere. Most of them are indirectly or directly funded by the organic foods cartel propaganda campaign and the rest did not even know about the 33 year long assault on modern farming by the cartel. They have no cogent refutations to the fact that GMO crop science is taking over globally so they resort to the shill gambit and some are so hateful and desperate they try to dox me.
Organic industry tyranny for 33 years and counting: "Although GMOs are regarded as safe as their conventional counterparts by every major food safety authority in the world, the organic industry spends nearly $3 billion a year through over 330 different organizations leading with fear and “information spin” as an industry to sell their products. By creating an unfounded fear that requires tighter regulations on GMO crops, they are hoping to force them out of the food supply, thereby creating a bigger market share to sell more products in their more than $65 billion wheelhouse.
The unfortunate consequence of these [non-GMO] labels is that the food companies and lobbyists tend to create an unnecessary “us vs. them” divide. When food companies use fear against competitors to sell a product, farmers take it personally."

Now why do you suppose organic food is so expensive?? Imagine what 3 billion dollars could do for humanitarian goals - end a different disease forever every year.... End all hunger in at least one country...... Funding nasty propaganda? Really??

After illegal seed planting in 2019, Indian farmers again demand access to GMO herbicide-tolerant cotton Cotton growers in Maharashtra are once again demanding permission to sow seeds of herbicide tolerant (Ht) genetically modified (GM) cotton. Former minister of state for agriculture Sudabhau Khot, while speaking to The Indian Express, expressed support for this demand.
Last year in June, the district collectorate of Akola had lodged [complaints] against farmer organizations who had carried out a civil disobedience movement and taken up sowing of non-approved variants. India …. has permitted just one GM crop-BT cotton. This variant was permitted for commercial release in 2002 by the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC).
Weeding has become a major issue for cotton growers, both due to the cost as well as the labor involved. In Maharashtra, growers said they end up paying as much as Rs 10,000 per acre for the process. With agriculture labor increasingly becoming spare, farmers have been surreptitiously sowing Ht Bt Cotton, relying on seed smuggled from neighboring states."

Farmers in Paraguay see major yield increases with GMO corn, despite degraded soil

Caazapá is a region with many riches, but in some areas its soils are very degraded. A group of producers is achieving success through work, permanent technical assistance, the introduction of sustainable practices and the correct use of biotechnology, with the support of the Institute of Agricultural Biotechnology (INBIO), reported Fabio Vega, extension specialist with the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (MAG).
“When we started, [farmer] Don Trifón Ruiz Díaz had a yield of tupi pytá corn of 800 kilograms per hectare, his cotton was around 680 kilograms per hectare, and chipá corn at 700 kilograms per hectare, in a highly degraded soil,” [Vega] recalled.
Díaz stressed that farmers were taught the correct use of biotechnology. “We learned about the varieties and their management, through which we were able to achieve better results …. [in 2019], when we had optimal weather conditions, we achieved significant yields,” said the producer. On that occasion, [Díaz ] corn yielded 7,000 kilograms per hectare; cotton, 2,970 kilograms per hectare."

Why grow GMOs? Because plants don’t naturally evolve into food fit for humans
Greg Bryan | ZeaKal | August 10, 2020
"Crop improvement has a history as old as human civilization. At its core is a strategy to pursue greater genetic diversity: conferring plants with new desirable traits or characteristics (which often runs counter to how plants are programmed to be competitive in the wild).
The oldest form of crop improvement is plant breeding, where breeders look for desirable qualities (yield, composition, resistance to pests/diseases) in different, but compatible plants of the same species and bring them together.
Breakthrough innovations including mutagenesis, hybridization and genetic modification offered further improvements overlaid on the steady gains made from breeding.
To reach a new plateau with our modern plant cultivars, we have to give plants new tools beyond the code that is in their genomes today. It bears repeating that plants evolved for survival and not human benefit. We as humans want seeds and grain that have maximum yield, are more nutritious and can thrive in adverse conditions.
However, the ancestral relative of a modern crop did not grow in a cultivated setting. It was programmed to ensure its survival across the broadest set of scenarios. There was no selective force to improve its seed yields beyond what it needs for reproduction. Grain or seed composition was historically not about human nutrition but seed viability."

"The US Food and Drug Administration [in conjunction with Texas A&M] announced this month that a genetically modified cottonseed has been green-lighted for human consumption. Researchers engineered the cotton plants to block the activity of the gene for an enzyme called δ-cadinene synthase in their seeds, which in turn prevents the seeds from making a toxin called gossypol. The plant had already been deregulated by the US Department of Agriculture last year.
One [hurdle] was finding the right gene silencing technology. Gossypol is important for the cotton plant, in the sense that it protects the plant from insect attack and some diseases. But . . . because of [the gossypol] we cannot utilize the seed. So one thing was to find a gene that we can silence, that will then eliminate this gossypol only from the seed.
Our cotton farmers in the US want this technology yesterday. Our hope is that, with this expanded use, in time the value of their crop will go up, because right now, cotton farmers don’t really get much money for their seed—they just grow cotton mainly for the fiber."

Soon Ganesh will have a new GMO cotton to plant that has edible seeds in addition to pest resistance. This is a VERY BIG DEAL as every pound of cotton fiber produces 1.6 pounds of seeds that are only suitable for cattle feed because of the natural toxic repellent gossypol produced by all cotton plants until now. When the entire world switches to GMO Bt edible seeds this will literally DOUBLE the amount of protein available from farm crop output! The seeds make a delicious hummus.

Who doesn’t remember this ridiculous line from their childhood? The schoolyard taunt was directed at a whole array of things that one might be inclined to defend – best friends, the teacher, or your favorite color crayon. Normally, or hopefully, most people grow out of such childish taunts when they reach an adult age and start to mature.
.... Most people, but not anti-GMO morons.
Apparently that isn’t necessarily true for anti-GMO activists and, unfortunately, one interviewer used such a taunt against a respected scientist while he was attempting to promote Golden Rice. The now infamous YouTube video shows a short clip of an interview with Dr. Patrick Moore, where he states that glyphosate does not cause cancer and that you could drink a quart of it without it hurting you. The interviewer then mocks Dr. Moore by offering him a glass of glyphosate to drink. Realizing the interview is a sham, Dr. Moore ends the interview and walks off camera.
The video clip launched the attack by anti-GMO activists of Dr. Moore and anyone supporting genetic modification – if glyphosate is so safe, then why don’t you drink it? Naturally, activists also alleged that Dr. Moore was a paid Monsanto lobbyist.

Taste is strictly developed by one thing only - picking at peak ripeness after a good growing season with the right amount of water and sun and fertilizer. Taste is identical with organic and GMO crops grown side by side on the same farm unless one of them are picked early so they won't rot on the way to market. But the organic ones will have insect damage and a smaller size without the great weed control and insect resistance of GMO farming. Organic crops can be contaminated by e-coli bacteria because they use liquid shit for fertilizer. Most deaths in the USA are caused by e-coli poisoning on organic crops.

Law suits by greedy lawyers never proved the cause of cancer claims. Juries and judges can not, and never have, determined science facts. There are no "bunches of farm workers" with cancers - I will now prove you posted a lie: *A new study on the increase in the heath of farmers since GMO crop science has become wide spread:
*
Peer reviewed and published 27 September 2019
"GM crops, particularly Bt cotton, has resulted in significant reductions in pesticide poisoning cases due to reduced applications and reduced levels of insecticide exposure. Reductions in farmer pesticide poisonings have been quantified in China, India, Pakistan and South Africa. Often cases of pesticide poisoning are not formally reported to health centers and the results on pesticide poisoning may be underestimated due to the lack of reporting. In South Africa, farmers reduced pesticide applications from 11.2 per year to 3.8, with reported cases of pesticide poisoning declining from over 50 per year to less than 10 over the first four years of Bt cotton adoption (Bennet et al. 2003). One-third of non-Bt cotton farmers in China reported cases of pesticide poisoning, compared to 9% of Bt cotton producing farmers (Hossain et al. 2004). Assessing the health impacts in India, reveals a reduction in cases of pesticide poisoning of 2.4 – 9 million cases per year (Kouser and Qaim 2011). Cumulatively, since 2003, when Bt cotton was first commercialized in India, a minimum of 38 million fewer instances of pesticide poisoning have occurred, with an upper potential of 144 million. Farmers in Pakistan growing non-Bt cotton reported up to seven instances of pesticide poisoning in the growing season with 35% reporting no instances, versus Bt cotton farmers reporting up to six poisonings with 45% reporting none (Kouser and Qaim 2013). A medical assessment of 246 Chinese farmers, involving 35 health indicators, found that fungicides associated with the production of non-Bt cotton had linkages to damaged liver function, while the insecticides used in non-Bt cotton production may be associated with severe nerve damage (Zhang et al. 2016). The use of non-glyphosate tolerant crops was found to likely reduce renal function and decrease serum folic acid.
CHANGES IN FARMER SUICIDES
Mental health challenges and issues affect all walks of life and economic sectors, with agriculture being no different. Access to sufficient mental health resources can be problematic within the agriculture sector due to rural areas, remote locations and lack of access to mental health support systems. Unfortunately, suicide is a concern in agriculture. India has one of the highest suicide ratesin the world and research has examined the relationship between farmer suicide and the adoption of GM cotton. Research examining the relationship between farm suicide and Bt cotton adoption revealed a plateauing of the suicide rate following the commercialization of Bt cotton (Gruère and Sengupta 2011). Farmer suicides were trending upward from 15,000 per year, peaking in 2004, the year after Bt cotton
was first commercialized in India. By 2007, the actual suicide rate was 25% below the extrapolated suicide rate. Cumulatively, the reduced rate of suicide associated with the adoption of Bt cotton represents the prevention of a minimum of 75,000 farmer suicides.
LOWERING CANCER INCIDENCES
The development of insect resistant crop varieties has begun to have a noticeable potential to improve human health through the reduction of cancer rates. Prior to the commercialization of Bt crops, maize in particular, insect damage to the harvested crop increased the potential for the development of harmful health effects. A study of 21 years of maize production quantified that Bt maize contained lower concentrations of mycotoxins (29%), fumonisins (31%) and thricotecens (37%) (Pellegrino et al. 2018). Mycotoxins are both toxic and carcinogenic to humans and animals and are considerably more concerning in developing economy food systems where access to food safety toxicity tests are less prevalent. Fumonisins are correlated to being the cause of higher rates of neural tube defects in high maize-based diets (Missmer et al. 2006). With food security challenges existing in many developing countries corn containing mycotoxins are consumed as part of the household diet due the lack of any other option.
NUTRITIONAL BENEFITS
GM crops have made significant contributions to address the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, in particular goals one (reducing poverty) and two (reducing hunger). While increased yields have contributed to higher household incomes, which reduces poverty, the increased yields have also enhanced household food security. Biofortified GM crops have been adopted, increasing micronutrient availability (Hefferon 2014). Nutritionally enhanced foods improve an individual’s nutrient intake, preventing and/or treating leading causes of death such as cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and hypertension. Improving the nutritional content of daily food consumption certainly has day to day effects, but of significant importance are the long term effects that extend for decades over the course of an individual’s lifetime. In many instances, improving macronutrients (proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, fiber) and micronutrients (vitamins, minerals, functional metabolites) has significant childhood health improvements, such as reducing blindness due to the lack of vitamin availability. Improved food nutrient content, especially the increase in mineral availability, contributes to improved immunity systems and reduces stunting. In many developing countries, plant-based nutrient intake accounts for one hundred per cent of an individual’s nutrient diet, further highlighting the importance of nutritionally enhanced crop derived foods. As the later in life benefits from improved childhood nutrition are better understood, the full value of nutritionally enhanced GM crops and foods, may not be realized for several decades." see the full paper at

Nope. Art is correct. You lied. Settlements were made without any admission of guilt or danger from Roundup by Bayer. No one here is lying more than you.
The global science consensus says you are nuts. GMO 20-year safety endorsement: 280 science institutions, more than 3,000 studies
"Currently, there is a social and political controversy about the safety of foods produced from genetically modified (GM) crops. However, in the scientific community, there is no dispute or controversy regarding the safety of these crops. To date, more than 3,000 scientific studies [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8] have assessed the safety of these crops in terms of human health and environmental impact. These studies together with several reviews performed on a case-by-case from regulatory agencies around the world have enabled a solid and clear scientific consensus: GM crops have no more risk than those that have been developed by conventional breeding techniques.
In addition, there is also extensive literature that compiles the socioeconomic and environmental benefits that transgenic crops have reported in two decades of commercialization [9,10].
This document brings together the public statements of technical and scientific institutions that adhere to this consensus. I made an update based on this document from ChileBio that initially included 40 official documents representing about 190 institutions – the document from ChileBio was subsequently updated in 2017 with the institutions and statements attached here.
The update shows that 284 technical and scientific institutions recognize the safety of GM crops and their potential benefits. Interestingly a large part of these institutions are located in Europe, the continent that has put more obstacles to the commercialization of these crops. On the other hand, the countries with most organizations in favor of GM crops are United Kingdom (33), United States (25), Italy (23), Spain (16) and Germany (11).
In conclusion, 284 technical and scientific institutions recognize that GM crops are not riskier than those produced by conventional breeding, and/or the potential benefits of these crops."

Odd.... that does not apply to science debates. Only verified published peer reviewed studies are correct and factual in debates about GMO crop benefits and safety. All else is posturing, egotism, lies, activism, propaganda or trolling. I win every debate here because I keep my personal opinions to myself and defer to the world class experts. I have fingered out the root cause of almost all Youtube trash about vital GMO crops: Organic industry tyranny for 33 years and counting: "Although GMOs are regarded as safe as their conventional counterparts by every major food safety authority in the world, the organic industry spends nearly $3 billion a year through over 330 different organizations leading with fear and “information spin” as an industry to sell their products. By creating an unfounded fear that requires tighter regulations on GMO crops, they are hoping to force them out of the food supply, thereby creating a bigger market share to sell more products in their more than $65 billion wheelhouse.
The unfortunate consequence of these [non-GMO] labels is that the food companies and lobbyists tend to create an unnecessary “us vs. them” divide. When food companies use fear against competitors to sell a product, farmers take it personally."

OK let's do it your way, the anti-biotech cherry picking way:
Glyphosate can cure cancer? Yes, some research ‘shows’ that — but what does it mean?
And what does it say about Roundup doomsday claims? "Now that three juries have said Bayer’s weed killer Roundup (glyphosate) causes cancer, many people believe there is clear evidence that the herbicide is dangerous. Organic industry-funded advocacy group U.S. Right to Know (USRTK) certainly wants consumers to believe that. The California-based nonprofit has played a key role in the three cases, providing evidence the plaintiffs’ lawyers have used to make their case. None of these claims stand up to scrutiny from independent scientists or oversight agencies, as GLP has reported extensively. But USRTK has employed a tactic (favored by political groups of all persuasions) in its opposition to glyphosate that is worth examining: Sifting through the peer-reviewed literature to find studies that support their argument, while dismissing contradictory research—widely known as “cherry picking.”
Selectively citing studies can lead to erroneous conclusions, which is why scientists criticize the practice and insist on evaluating all the available research, a standard known as “preponderance of evidence.” But if you want to show that glyphosate is dangerous, despite a mountain of contrary data, picking cherries is a useful approach.
To illustrate how easy it is to defend an unsubstantiated hypothesis, and why we should be skeptical of sensational claims about chemical harm or safety, let’s “demonstrate” that glyphosate might be a ‘cure’ for cancer by highlighting only the research that helps make the case. Over the past several years, a handful of studies published in peer-reviewed journals and conducted by researchers at reputable universities has in fact suggested that glyphosate possesses cancer-fighting properties. The first such study was published in 2013. Researchers exposed human cancer cells in-vitro, or outside their normal biological context, to glyphosate and AMPA (the degradation product produced when glyphosate is metabolized). The experiment showed both substances inhibited cancer cell growth and promoted apoptosis (cell suicide), but left healthy cells unharmed, “…. suggesting that they have [potential] to be developed into a new anticancer therapy,” the authors concluded.
The researchers published a followup study in 2015 and got a similar result. They exposed human prostate cancer cell lines to AMPA and a chemical called methoxyacetic acid (MAA), concluding that both chemicals could “…. be used as potential therapeutic drugs in the treatment of prostate cancer.”
Glyphosate testing in animals hints at therapeutic potential
In a 2016 study, the research team that found potentially therapeutic effects of glyphosate tested their thesis in animals. They exposed 25 mice to two different doses of AMPA. Compared to a control group of 14 mice, the experiment revealed that “….treatment significantly inhibited growth and metastasis of …. prostate tumors and prolonged the survival time of the mice.” Summarizing their findings, the authors wrote:
[T]hese results demonstrate that …. AMPA may be developed into a therapeutic agent for the treatment of prostate cancer.
Adding another interesting piece of data to the equation, consumer products company Procter & Gamble owns the patent on a pharmaceutical drug that contains glyphosate as an active ingredient and is designed to kill colon, breast and lung human tumor cells. According to the company, glyphosate in combination with a plant growth regulator called chloroprofam was “…. effective in killing tumor cells without significantly affecting healthy cells.” The unmarketed drug is potentially very interesting because it targeted cancer cells specifically and was also effective against viruses including HIV, herpes and influenza."

"Changes in USDA food composition data for 43 garden crops, 1950 to 1999
Donald R Davis 1, Melvin D Epp, Hugh D Riordan
Affiliations expand
PMID: 15637215 DOI: 10.1080/07315724.2004.10719409
Abstract
Objectives: To evaluate possible changes in USDA nutrient content data for 43 garden crops between 1950 and 1999 and consider their potential causes.
Methods: We compare USDA nutrient content data published in 1950 and 1999 for 13 nutrients and water in 43 garden crops, mostly vegetables. After adjusting for differences in moisture content, we calculate ratios of nutrient contents, R (1999/1950), for each food and nutrient. To evaluate the foods as a group, we calculate median and geometric mean R-values for the 13 nutrients and water. To evaluate R-values for individual foods and nutrients, with hypothetical confidence intervals, we use USDA's standard errors (SEs) of the 1999 values, from which we generate 2 estimates for the SEs of the 1950 values."

"The shill gambit is a type of ad hominem or poisoning the well logical fallacy, wherein one party dismisses the other’s argument by proclaiming them to be on the payroll of some company.
Sometimes known as the Big Pharma Shill Gambit or the Monsanto Shill Gambit. The shill gambit is used fallaciously when the only “evidence” given of such a connection to a big company or government is the endorsement of the position of the government or company, without any other evidence–the implication is that they provide that endorsement only because they receive some sort of compensation from the company or other agency.On the other hand when such conflict of interest is both demonstrated by verifiable evidence and can be shown to interfere with a person’s judgement of the evidence, then it’s no longer a logical fallacy.
Example -
Clearly, anything the writer says about pharmaceuticals or GMOs can be dismissed because, even though I can’t prove it, they are obviously being paid by Monsanto and Big Pharma to spread the lies." This despite the fact that Monsanto shut down forever in 2017!!!

Jan 26, 2019 "People who most intensely oppose genetically modified food think they know a lot about food science, but they actually know the least, according to a peer-reviewed paper published in January in the journal Nature Human Behaviour.
GMOs are widely considered safe by scientists, but opponents have said they want more science on the potential harm so that subjective arguments aren't part of the equation. However, previous surveys have shown that providing more scientific facts about GMOs to people doesn't change their minds.
The survey, conducted by four universities, asked 2,000 people in Europe and the United States how much they knew about genetically modified food, what their opinion was and how intense it was." Read the full coverage at:

Yes, when patents expire they revert to the public.
That's right, the Perp never bought GMO canola seed but he knew what he had. He had various stories about how he came about these seeds, they fell off passing truck onto his ditches by the road, or the GMO seed blew into his field from neighboring GMO canola fields.
Then he purposely selected for them for two growing seasons and by the third growing season he miraculously had 1,000 acres of GMO canola in nice neat rows that he stole the technology for. He knowingly and purposely did so. The Perp is the one that stepped "on another person's basic right to live and make a living? That's plain evil.
Learn to read and comprehend Gran.
[USER 610 NAME] did NOT state that as you said [USER 610 NAME] did that "GMO crops can be sold without a contract or restrictions". [USER 610 NAME] said that the first patent on GMO soy expired and the University of Arkansas is growing it and selling the seed from it.
GMO row crops have only been planted in the world since 1996 so if you got rid of seed patents you would have wiped out thousands and thousands of beneficial traits that never would have been created since 1930.
You wrote, "BTW you mentioned above that seeds can be sold without contracts so it's also possible to research about plants to get those beneficial traits without patenting it."
Once again, [USER 610 NAME] NEVER WROTE THAT. [USER 610 NAME] wrote that seeds from EXP[USER 610 NAME]RED patents can be sold and save without a contract. [USER 610 NAME]f the patent system did not exist those traits never would have been developed for GM seeds or any other seed.
Seed patents have greatly helped humanity and you would have never allowed it. You don't really care about helping humanity.

If you love it so much, why don’t you marry it?
Who doesn’t remember this ridiculous line from their childhood? The schoolyard taunt was directed at a whole array of things that one might be inclined to defend – best friends, the teacher, or your favorite color crayon. Normally, or hopefully, most people grow out of such childish taunts when they reach an adult age and start to mature.
.... Most people, but not anti-GMO morons.
Apparently that isn’t necessarily true for anti-GMO activists and, unfortunately, one interviewer used such a taunt against a respected scientist while he was attempting to promote Golden Rice. The now infamous YouTube video shows a short clip of an interview with Dr. Patrick Moore, where he states that glyphosate does not cause cancer and that you could drink a quart of it without it hurting you. The interviewer then mocks Dr. Moore by offering him a glass of glyphosate to drink. Realizing the interview is a sham, Dr. Moore ends the interview and walks off camera.
The video clip launched the attack by anti-GMO activists of Dr. Moore and anyone supporting genetic modification – if glyphosate is so safe, then why don’t you drink it? Naturally, activists also alleged that Dr. Moore was a paid Monsanto lobbyist.

Novel traits have been able to be patented since the first one in 1930, the climbing rose. Just because someone patented a trait in a rose did not mean that all roses were the property of that person.

Industry insider journals? Which one reported glyphosate levels approaching the RfD? Or even the MRL? The answer is none. Your experience in the "drinks" business is great but you level of understanding of toxicology and risk analysis is lacking.
Here is an excerpt from Germany's BfR specifically addressing this issue:
Assessment of glyphosate levels in beer
Updated BfR Communication No. 024/2017 of 25 August 20171
"Even the highest glyphosate content in beer reported in 2016 (30 micrograms per litre) is so
low that the intake for an adult (60 kg bodyweight) calculated on this basis would be more
than 1000 times lower than the currently estimated amount that can be ingested daily over a
lifetime without appreciable health risk (ADI – acceptable daily intake) or than the acute reference dose (ARfD – the amount of substance per kg bodyweight that can be ingested with
food at one meal or within the course of one day without a discernible health risk to consumers). In order to ingest quantities of glyphosate that would pose a health risk, an adult would
have to drink roughly 1000 litres of beer in one day. According to the current state of
knowledge, glyphosate levels of 30 micrograms per litre beer and clearly below as currently
reported do not pose a health risk."

You are clueless what GMO science is. To make a better seed in a laboratory it takes a million dollar lab, a team of scientists and years of research, followed by the wait to get the seed approved by the FDA. That takes an average of 13 years to complete in the US. In comparison, conventional breeding methods take hundreds or thousands of years to really refine a crop to ideal. There are just a few basic methods like saving the best seeds each year, and grafting. Corn was created by seed saving of the wild teosinte grass over 10,000 years.
So if you are a farmer, will you wait an entire lifetime for a better seed to be developed and possibly lose the farm because you did not get it fast enough, or will you ask a seed company to make better seed and be willing to pay a small royalty? One of the thousands of facts you should know before commenting is that seed patents all expire after 20 years. There are now generic GMO seeds being sold at a bargain price, such is the gift of modern crop science to humanity.
You demonstrated a deep lack of respect for our honest hard working farmers and crop scientists.

There is little to say about glyphosate and the environment because it is by far the least toxic herbicide ever formulated. ALL PATENTS EXPIRE after 20 years. GMO soybeans are generic and cheap now, a bargain for farmers. FARMERS DO NOT WANT TO REPLANT HYBRID SEEDS!!! Farmers quit saving Hybrid seed in mid 1930's and as each crop became a hybrid farmers quit saving seed from that crop. We have had patented seed ever since Congress passed the Plant Variety Protection Act in 1970 Protecting Plant Breeders with patent rights. It is illegal to save patented seed and does not mater if it is GMO or non GMO seed. Farmers are law abiding citizens but some think they are above the law. If you save seed do not buy patented seed to do so. A first grade child can understand that. There are many companies even foreign companies producing and selling GMO technology seed. That favorite whipping boy Monsanto was bought out and when it did exist it only controlled 20% of the GM seed market globally. All patents expire 20 years from the date they were filed. Expired patent seed is a gift to humanity.

NGOs have learned that it is the education of women that helps them to decide completely on their own to have fewer children. This has been common knowledge and a basis for NGO policy for over a decade now. It works.
Capitalism is not evil and half of all GMO seed today is being given free to struggling farmers by NGOs and government seed programs. Corporations are not involved unless they are donating funds for tax breaks. Monsanto donated its patent on golden rice to humanitarian efforts and can never profit off that. If donated seed is patented it is to protect it from being stolen and hoarded for profit by corrupt governments and soldiers.

Overpopulation hurts the entire world no matter where it happens. Those countries lag behind and can't contribute to global stability, they become liabilities like most African nations already have. But there is hope, 3 African nations have embraced GMO crop science for their first time, this year.

Idiot! Growing a crop guarantees its survival. NOT growing it means only sample seeds in seed banks and vaults. Nothing we eat is "natural" nor has it been for the last 10,000 years since we began breeding all we eat for better yields and performance. Endangered species are ALL outside the list of what we grow for food. Only a grade school flunkie would post garbage like yours.

Half of all GMO seed today is given away completely free by non-profit NGOs and government seed programs. Where is the predation there? ALL FARMING OF EVERY SORT IS INVASIVE TO NATURE therefore it can't be a "very,very bad idea" unless you want to insist that human survival above stone age existence is bad.

You don't talk like an experienced professional. They all know that seed companies ONLY SELL SEED. They never plant and grow the seed, your local farmers do that. In no case does that relate to your nutty idea that someone is "giving their food supply to a company". Food supplies are sold by farmers to the pubic or to just feed their own families. Seed companies have NO say in that.

The EFSA has accepted the safety of glyphosate. There are FEWER cancers in 1st world nations, not more, and that is not in any way directly connected to foods, you completely ignored the more likely suspects like air and water pollution which are proven to be carcinogenic in many cases. The very concept of 'natural' is a joke now. There is no longer an accurate definition for that word, especially when applied to foods. What is disgusting about using a common mustard plant to derive cauliflower, cabbage, broccoli, brussels sprouts, kale and turnips from? We did that for our benefit and new GMOs continue in that vein while dealing with increasing challenges to farmers from global warming and rising populations.

Sorry, that's a very ignorant and completely false conspiracy theory about Monsanto hou hears on some activist site or video. First of all, that company no longer exists. But if you add up ALL seeds and pesticides sold by the big 5 corporations it is less than 20% of what the world uses. There are 700 brands of glyphosate herbicides sold on Earth and only 3 of them have the former Monsanto name. China is the world's largest seller of glyphosate. Your "control and power" memes are bullshit, that simply does not exist, it is myth spun by organic farmer activists to get you to buy more organic produce. You can't name a single corporation or farmer who is non-profit so that greed bullshit is stupid too.

That is absolute nonsense. ONLY the specific GMO trait called Bt can kill crop pests. ONLY certain borer worms have the exact cells in their stomachs that can be affected by the Bt protein which is one of 20,000 protein molecules. No other living things, including all animals and plants, have the cells this works on. It is harmless to humans and animals. The great thing about natural pest protection is it requies no pesticides, reducing the amount of chemicals farmers need to protect their crops. Bt comes from a natural soil bacteria, it has been used by organic farmers for 40 years. Chocolate is poison to dogs. Where is your outrage about chocolate??

GMO is a breeding method only. GMOs are NOT new life forms, this breeding is a continuation of thousands of years of breeding the same plants to improve them. Corn has been eaten for over 10,000 years and GMO corn is no different except it does not require insecticides which makes it safer for everyone.

False. Fair distribution can never be achieved in most of the world. Many humanitarians died trying. Hunger is used as a weapon of war and climate change has increased crop failures dramatically. Food waste in the USA can not be transported to starving drought refugees in Africa. They need better seed and the latest crop science is developing better seed that can do well in droughts, floods, extreme temperatures and salty soils. Every time you post a lie about food here you hurt someone who is starving.

That is a very ignorant comment isolated from education in crop science. There is nothing simple about complex crop pest problems. Greed has NOTHING to do with this you ignorant liar. Humans farm their food or die, no greed involved! All GMO seeds and pesticides are tested for years in advance before approval. It is not possible for them to suddenly start killing beneficial insects after years of test felds where that never happened. You also repeat that idiotic Youtube click bait fraud lie about the gut biome - glylphosate can NOT have any effect on our gut - it only kills weeds with the Shikimate cellular pathway. No animals or insects or other plants. That's why educated people and farmers love it and prefer it. This TED video is 100% accurate and based in proven science while YOU are an ignorant narrow minded fool who believes all the propaganda from lying organic industry lobbyists.

As of 2021, there are more GMO crops grown overseas than in the USA. Most of them were government or humanitarian projects to get the seeds farmers need without patents, giving it to them free. Ten nations planted their first GMO crops this year - Russia, Cuba, 6 African nations, Philippines and Bangladesh. None of those are 'corporate' in origin. None are glyphosate resistant. Norman Borlaug quote: "There are 6.6 billion people on the planet today. With organic farming we could only feed 4 billion of them. Which two billion would volunteer to die?"

There is a nasty anti-science troll who is abusing Youtube to post lies about our biotech experts and educational organizations. She has a loser channel with videos that nobody watches. Here is her offense copied and pasted so she can not delete all my replies to it when she deletes her own top comment for the third time, and note she is so out of it she thinks Monsanto still exists, almost 4 years after it shut down forever:
NATURAL HEALTH REMEDY
"First, Pamela Ronald has multiple ties to a leading agrichemical industry front group, the Genetic Literacy Project (created by Monsanto), and its executive director, Jon Entine.
Secondly, selective breeding animals or selective plant grafting is not the same as genetically modifying DNA gene sequences by using a Gene Gun to randomly inject DNA from one species into another, which has never existed in the history of the world; its mutagenic outcomes are numerous and is why there are so many autoimmune diseases like autism and cancer of which we've never seen in the numbers we see today.
The increase of autism alone since GMOs were secretly introduced into our food supply in the mid-1990s, the rate has increased 800%. It's also the glyphosate (Roundup) that is sprayed on GM crops that cause a host of diseases, which was created by Monsanto. Bayer is the new Monsanto."
Note the total lack of any links to prove a single insane activist lie she posted.

No. Cows with 'claws' are simply in need of routine hoof trimming that is part of the responsibility of every farmer. We trim goat and sheep hooves too. It is because their life is too easy in captivity. No food animal is given 'testosterone'. You are very confused and poorly educated. You may have meant hormones but the use of that has dropped a lot in the last ten years.

You did not read my first reply so I'm not posting this for your benefit, but for others. I repeat - captive animals do not get the normal wear on hooves and claws like they do in the wild. Same reason dog owners need to clip their nails. In all parts of the world, animal abuse cases frequently involve seeing hooved creatures who can barely walk because they were not cared for and trimmed. If you put deer or antelope in barns they need trimming just the same. Like I said, you make a fool of yourself by commenting on things you do not understand, from a point of ignorance.

[USER 719] = lying about what he calls junk foods. GMO ingredients in the USA are mostly being used to feed cattle and to make ethanol, not for 'junk food'. Refined sweeteners and oils are no longer legally designated as GMO foods even when they come from GMO crops because the refining process removes all traces of DNA and stray proteins.

Human safety feeding trials study, including quantified human risk assessment, that trolls say do not exist: Golden rice is designed to make a change in the human body with Vit. A. This is an exception to most GMO foods so Codex compliant human testing was done. Below is the linked study that verified the human safety and nutrition trials. Note that only one serving per person was required to verify the proper nutrition from golden rice. Additional servings would be a waste of time, as determined by multiple safety agencies who peer reviewed the process.
"So "why don't we do clinical trials on GMOs the same way we do for drugs?" Drugs are designed to cause a change in the human body: that's the whole point behind them. Since drugs are altering something in humans, it's important to know the side-effects that they may cause and whether or not they're causing the anticipated effect (i.e. is it better than placebo). In contrast, GMOs are designed to be equivalent to their non-GE counterparts: they aren't drugs or nutritional supplements."

Peru is an extremely ignorant uneducated fool. GMO is proven good, that is why it is being grown more every year and more countries are now using it for the first time. All patents expire and become treasured bargain seed.
More than half of all GMO seeds being used today (by variety, not tonnage) are not for or from US agribusiness or corporations.
They are for specific applications in many different parts of the world where climate change is causing additional challenges. Most of them are not patented. Most of them are given away free to struggling farmers by NGOs and govt seed programs:

Monsanto shut down 3 years ago, idiot. It always had competitors. Glyphosate is by far the least toxic of all herbicides. It is 43% less toxic than table salt. Baking soda is twice as toxic.

GMO 20-year safety endorsement: 280 science institutions, more than 3,000 studies
"Currently, there is a social and political controversy about the safety of foods produced from genetically modified (GM) crops. However, in the scientific community, there is no dispute or controversy regarding the safety of these crops. To date, more than 3,000 scientific studies [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8] have assessed the safety of these crops in terms of human health and environmental impact. These studies together with several reviews performed on a case-by-case from regulatory agencies around the world have enabled a solid and clear scientific consensus: GM crops have no more risk than those that have been developed by conventional breeding techniques.
In addition, there is also extensive literature that compiles the socioeconomic and environmental benefits that transgenic crops have reported in two decades of commercialization [9,10].
This document brings together the public statements of technical and scientific institutions that adhere to this consensus. I made an update based on this document from ChileBio that initially included 40 official documents representing about 190 institutions – the document from ChileBio was subsequently updated in 2017 with the institutions and statements attached here.
The update shows that 284 technical and scientific institutions recognize the safety of GM crops and their potential benefits. Interestingly a large part of these institutions are located in Europe, the continent that has put more obstacles to the commercialization of these crops. On the other hand, the countries with most organizations in favor of GM crops are United Kingdom (33), United States (25), Italy (23), Spain (16) and Germany (11).
In conclusion, 284 technical and scientific institutions recognize that GM crops are not riskier than those produced by conventional breeding, and/or the potential benefits of these crops."

Humans have been using pesticides for 200 years. Fertilizer for at least 15,000 years. HUMAN OVER POPULATION is the root cause of all harm to nature. The best we can do to minimize damage is to farm with high efficiency, leaving the greatest number of acres untouched. The single most damaging act a human can do is to reproduce.

You are a science illiterate fool!!! Bt comes from natural soil bacteria that has always been there. Organic farmers have been using it for 40 years. The active molecule in Bt is just a protein, an extremely specific molecule that can only find cells to bind with in borer worm crop pests. NO OTHER LIVING THING can be affected by Bt. You could eat a pure 2 ounce chunk of it, enough to treat half an acre, with no effect.

Organic industry tyranny for 32 years and counting:
"Although GMOs are regarded as safe as their conventional counterparts by every major food safety authority in the world, the organic industry spends nearly $3 billion a year through over 330 different organizations leading with fear and “information spin” as an industry to sell their products. By creating an unfounded fear that requires tighter regulations on GMO crops, they are hoping to force them out of the food supply, thereby creating a bigger market share to sell more products in their more than $65 billion wheelhouse.
The unfortunate consequence of these [non-GMO] labels is that the food companies and lobbyists tend to create an unnecessary “us vs. them” divide. When food companies use fear against competitors to sell a product, farmers take it personally."

You are so fucked by the facts !!! "Though much of the controversy around genetically modified crops is driven by the belief that the process of moving genes from one species to another is “unnatural,” new research shows some 1 in 20 flowering plants are naturally transgenic. Dozens of plants, including bananas, peanuts, Surinam cherries, hops, cranberries and tea, contain the Agrobacterium microbe — the very same bacterium that scientists typically use to create GM crops. The research follows on the heels of the 2015 discovery that sweet potatoes are naturally transgenic. Agrobacterium DNA also has been found in tobacco plants.The findings were reported in a paper published Sept. 21 in the journal Plant Molecular Biology. Researchers studied the genomes of some 356 dicot species and found 15 naturally occurring transgenic species. “Thus, HGT [horizontal gene transfer] from Agrobacterium to dicots is remarkably widespread,” the abstract stated.
It has also been discovered that the horticultural process of grafting different plants together can lead to the exchange of genes, meaning humans have inadvertently been creating transgenic plants for millennia. From genome studies, we can see that gene swapping has been going on since the dawn of life.

Human safety feeding trials study, including quantified human risk assessment, that trolls say do not exist: Golden rice is designed to make a change in the human body with Vit. A. This is an exception to most GMO foods so Codex compliant human testing was done. Here is the study that verified the human safety and nutrition trials:
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/
PMC2682994/ Note that only one serving per person was required to verify the proper nutrition from golden rice. Additional servings would be a waste of time, as determined by multiple safety agencies who peer reviewed the process.
"So "why don't we do clinical trials on GMOs the same way we do for drugs?" Drugs are designed to cause a change in the human body: that's the whole point behind them. Since drugs are altering something in humans, it's important to know the side-effects that they may cause and whether or not they're causing the anticipated effect (i.e. is it better than placebo). In contrast, GMOs are designed to be equivalent to their non-GE counterparts: they aren't drugs or nutritional supplements."

You are spewing activist nonsense. SEED COMPANIES, NOT CHEMICAL COMPANIES give farmers what they want and only what they want. Seed companies who also have chemical divisions are perfectly happy to sell farmers seeds that require no pesticides to use. HT Bt corn, soy and cotton need no herbicides or pesticides.
Seed companies have always preferred Hawaii and Puerto Rico for their test fields because the climates let them plant year around. Hawaiians have been ignorant assholes for years while PR welcomes those companies with open arms as they provide jobs.

You are very ignorant and science illiterate. GMOs are the future of food. The WHO, EPA, EFSA and 281 other agencies all affirm that GMOs and glyphosate are totally safe and cause no unintended consequences. Full global consensus!

12 WAYS ORGANIC ACTIVISTS MISLEAD CONSUMERS
I guarantee you have heard most or all of these malicious lies frequently on Youtube and from activists!
Each of these lies are carefully debunked and the dishonesty is exposed in the link for this article I provided at the bottom.
Lie #1: Conventional farmers don’t care about their soil; only organic farmers do
Lie #2: Conventional farmers douse or drench their produce in pesticides
Lie #3: Regulators are in the pocket of big industry and don’t even check if pesticides are safe
Lie #4: Organic farmers do not use pesticides or if they do, they are nice and gentle (and they only use a little)
Lie #5: Growing food naturally is always better and more sustainable
Lie #6: You can feed the world without agri-tech
Lie #7: Integrated Pest Management excludes the use of pesticides
Lie #8: The over-reliance on herbicides is leading to an explosion of super-weeds
Lie #9: Pesticide drift is a major issue
Lie #10: Our present agricultural model was built on the need to reapportion toxic chemicals after WWII
Lie #11: Large chemical companies lobby to remove regulations
Lie #12: Pesticides are a main cause of cancer

Playing the shill gambit is always a forfeit of the debate at hand. It is a pathetic form of cheating by trying to poison the well rather than countering with a cogent refutation that might prove your point or win a debate. I see lameoids pull this stupid blunder 10 times a day in the GMO debate. If you want to prove a fault in science, use the tools scientists use, peer reviewed studies and unbiased information sources. If you don't have solid evidence, consider what a fool you are being. Shill shill shill just makes you look like a blathering idiot and forfeits every time, the win goes to science truth. Explained simply here(or in the dictionary of your choice):
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisoning_the_well
This is especially ludicrous when you consider the GMO safety debate ended two full years ago and no company for profit anywhere would spend a single penny paying a "shill" to promote something already attained in 2016:

Your post is false. Bt gmo technology is now being use in Europe as in all over the world. Organic growers have used Bt for decades even injecting some food with Bt. I am sure you have heard of Bt corn. Bt corn contains naturally occurring Bacillus thuringiensis bacteria, a result of recombinant DNA techniques. that selectively kill caterpillar pest. Organic growers have for decades approved sprays containing Bt, a naturally occurring soil bacterium. Bt produces biotoxins lethal to moths,caterpillars and butterflies when ingested. Because it targets these insects' intestinal membranes(ABSENT in HUMANS and ANIMALS ), the EPA considers it benign to non- caterpillar species, including beneficial insects. When Organic growers spray Bt they kill all moths,caterpillars, and butterflies but we do not do that with gmo corn because only corn bore and corn rootworms attacks corn so they are the only insects affected. For 80 years farmers like me used dangerous dangerous pesticides to control theses insects but today we do not have to use them thanks to gmo technology. GMO technology is safer for my children, my Wife, our water, our farm, and our environment. WE and YOU should give thanks to almighty GOD for the wisdom of GMO Technology.

Your question make no sense. Using no till farming methods has nothing to do with whether you purchase herbicide tolerant seed or not. Most of the better hybrids with better genetics have herbicide tolerance traits. To put in term you might understand. If you want buy a Cadillac automobile you are going to have air conditioning in that car whether you use it or not. The real cost to gmo technology seed is when they use Bt. Glyphosate is harmless to all insects as other herbicides are also. What crops would you use glyphosate on that bees would be around? Is there other herbicides that you would make the same stupid claim about? Roundup (Glyphosate) is known as a non-selective herbicide and considered to be fairly harmless to the environment, food sources and animal life. It works on most persistent weeds and its main active ingredient is glyphosate. Glyphosate is an acid but for the application in Roundup it is presented as its potassium salt. The amount in the solution is 5.5 lbs. per gallon. Roundup(Glyphosate) is a post-emergent herbicide, which means you apply it when the weed is growing. The glyphosate targets the EPSP synthase, a key enzyme plants need to make amino acids, a crucial building block of their cells. Without the ability to make amino acids, the plant cells starve to death. The herbicide penetrates foliar structures, such as leaves, but does not penetrate woody stems or trunks, which makes it safe to spray around trees. Glyphosate quickly breaks down into naturally occurring carbon dioxide and nitrogen, rendering it harmless.

Your post is TOTA[USER 730 NAME] GARBAGE and proves you are clueless. Corn is naturally tolerant to Dicamba and some Farmers have been using this herbicide since it was approved in 1962. Many farmers use Dicamba and I have seen no problems when they do. Glyphosate can NOT be used along highways, in parks, golf courses, and schoolyards. Glyphosate will kill all grass dead. Glyphosate is harmless to all insects. Many herbicides even Organic pesticides require a surfactant. Thank You for admitting it is not the Glyphosate. We keep setting new yield records almost yearly since we have been using gmo technology crops and Glyphosate for the last 24 years so your post is garbage..Glyphosate does not enter the waterways and big reason we love it. Can you tell me the rate of Glyphosate that is used per acre? Glyphosate is the safest herbicide we have ever used even safer than many of the highly toxic pesticides Organic Growers use.

You need to learn how to read. I said Glyphosate can NOT be used along highways, in parks, golf courses, and schoolyards" - because iit kills grass dead. Nothing in your post is correct. Glyphosate is harmless to insects, worms and all organisms. Glyphosate will be used in Agriculture until something better comes along. Glyphosate does not enter the water supply as some other herbicides may. Out of all the many many many many herbicides farmers could choose to use on their gmo technology crops can you name one that is safer than Glyphosate? What country are you from to be so misinformed?

Genetic engineering prescisely picks one or two genes for a specific trait and "species hybridization" breeding mixes thousands of genes hoping for the trait you want.
Point out the specific harms from crop biotechnology. Exactly please and with supporting citations. Leave glyphosate out of it. Your main point again was that ""There is a huge difference" between the two so point out the harms of GE.

No you idiot!! Without 20 year patents there would be no interest in the huge investments companies need to develop better seed. Even the non-profit NGOs and government seed programs patent their seed to protect it from profiteering and theft by corrupt governments and soldiers. All patents expire, GMO soybeans have been off patent and cheap for 5 years now, open sourced and a bargain for farmers. This happens to every patented seed. No one ever works for free, profit is never a valid talking point.

I REPEAT - THE FDA made that ruling for AMERICAN diets, NOT Asian diets!! The FDA has in fact approved GR2E for US consumption since that article you linked was posted on an activist site that pushes organic foods. But we don't need it in the US and it will not be marketed here because our diets are so much better. ASIAN kids eat 25 times as much rice as US kids each week so the FDA clarified that they endorse GR2E for use in regions with vitamin A deficiency. The original FDA statement was based on the very small amount of rice in US diets which is not itself enough to ingest enough vitamin from GR2E, they DO approve it when a larger amount if rice is eaten regularly. You are posting lies from a stance of stupidity and hatred.

The Seralini studies were ALL DEBUNKED PERMANENTLY by a huge 7 year long EU project to systematically repeat the Seralini findings. No study is factual if it can not be repeated and the EU thought they would settle the controversy forever by investigating Seralini's accuracy. Their faces turned red as it became obvious every one of his faked quack studies funded by organic farmers turned out to be flawed and bogus. Seralini is fucked forever as history records hims as this century's top quack fraud:

You don't even understand what you are posting. That FDA statement was for AMERICAN children only - Asian kids eat literally 25 times as much rice and golden rice does in fact work great for them. "Finally, the FDA weighed in on Golden Rice, with its May 24 announcement approving it for use in the United States. This approval, just a few months after Canada, Australia and New Zealand’s agencies issued theirs, is largely symbolic, since the International Rice Research Institute, now the makers of Golden Rice, have no intention of selling the product in the United States."

Organic industry tyranny for 32 years and counting: "Although GMOs are regarded as safe as their conventional counterparts by every major food safety authority in the world, the organic industry spends nearly $3 billion a year through over 330 different organizations leading with fear and “information spin” as an industry to sell their products. By creating an unfounded fear that requires tighter regulations on GMO crops, they are hoping to force them out of the food supply, thereby creating a bigger market share to sell more products in their more than $65 billion wheelhouse.
[USER 739 NAME] unfortunate consequence of these [non-GMO] labels is that the food companies and lobbyists tend to create an unnecessary “us vs. them” divide. When food companies use fear against competitors to sell a product, farmers take it personally."

Who says? What proof do you have? How can you prove that all Monsanto CEOs were not fired, all Monsanto workers laid off, all Monsanto facilities closed two years ago? How can you prove that there is not just Bayer AG now? Bayer owns the product names and patents now. How is WHAT "worse"??? Remember that all Youtube videos against GMOs lie to get you to click on them. All Youtube videos on chemtrails, vaccines and fluoride are 100% lies. That leaves you with nothing.

You are off the fucking deep end. Youtube videos are 99% all LIES on the topic of GMO foods. There are over 40 [forty] deceptively edited videos copied from one activist source that deceptively edited the interview with Patrick Moore. I have seen the original. "Although GMOs are regarded as safe as their conventional counterparts by every major food safety authority in the world, the organic industry spends nearly $3 billion a year through over 330 different organizations leading with fear and “information spin” as an industry to sell their products. By creating an unfounded fear that requires tighter regulations on GMO crops, they are hoping to force them out of the food supply, thereby creating a bigger market share to sell more products in their more than $65 billion wheelhouse.
The unfortunate consequence of these [non-GMO] labels is that the food companies and lobbyists tend to create an unnecessary “us vs. them” divide. When food companies use fear against competitors to sell a product, farmers take it personally."
https://www.agdaily.com/insights/farm-babe-label-trends-end/
Now why do you suppose organic food is so expensive?? Imagine what 3 billion dollars could do for humanitarian goals - end a different disease forever every year.... End all hunger in at least one country...... Funding nasty propaganda? Really??

There is a nasty anti-science troll going by 'Natural Health Remedy' who is abusing Youtube to post lies about our biotech experts and educational organizations. She has a loser channel with videos that nobody watches. Here is her offense copied and pasted so she can not delete all my replies to it when she deletes her own top comment for the third time, and note she is so out of it she thinks Monsanto still exists, almost 4 years after it shut down forever: NATURAL HEALTH REMEDY 3 days ago "First, Pamela Ronald has multiple ties to a leading agrichemical industry front group, the Genetic Literacy Project (created by Monsanto), and its executive director, Jon Entine.
Secondly, selective breeding animals or selective plant grafting is not the same as genetically modifying DNA gene sequences by using a Gene Gun to randomly inject DNA from one species into another, which has never existed in the history of the world; its mutagenic outcomes are numerous and is why there are so many autoimmune diseases like autism and cancer of which we've never seen in the numbers we see today.
The increase of autism alone since GMOs were secretly introduced into our food supply in the mid-1990s, the rate has increased 800%. It's also the glyphosate (Roundup) that is sprayed on GM crops that cause a host of diseases, which was created by Monsanto. Bayer is the new Monsanto."

THIS IS REFUTATION NUMBER 203 COMPLETE WITH HYPERLINKS OF PROOF THAT PROVES THE '[USER 89]' TROLL IS LYING FOR THE 201st TIME: Human safety feeding trials study, including quantified human risk assessment, that trolls say do not exist: Golden rice is designed to make a change in the human body with Vit. A. This is an exception to most GMO foods so Codex compliant human testing was done. Here is the study that verified the human safety and nutrition trials: ncbi . lm . nih . gov/pmc/articles/ PMC2682994/ Note that only one serving per person was required to verify the proper nutrition from golden rice. Additional servings would be a waste of time, as determined by multiple safety agencies who peer reviewed the process.
"So "why don't we do clinical trials on GMOs the same way we do for drugs?" Drugs are designed to cause a change in the human body: that's the whole point behind them. Since drugs are altering something in humans, it's important to know the side-effects that they may cause and whether or not they're causing the anticipated effect (i.e. is it better than placebo). In contrast, GMOs are designed to be equivalent to their non-GE counterparts: they aren't drugs or nutritional supplements." geneticliteracyproject . org/2016/01/13/ no-long-term-gmo -studies-humans/

The J Temple troll still thinks there was ever such a thing as "Monsanto/Bayer". Fool! Monsanto was completely absorbed by Bayer AG in Germany over 3 years ago. No Monsanto workers remain. Only registered Monsanto product names remain. But not Roundup - that patent expired 18 years ago.

It adds to existing biodiversity and seed choices. All previous seeds used by farmers are still available on hobby farms or in seed banks and vaults.

GM crops do not deliver more nutrition pound for pound than organic or non-gmo crops, they deliver equivalent nutrition. Otherwise they would not have been granted permission to grow the 10 GM crops currently on the market.

Real life facts and studies prove that GMOs are the safest of all foods you can buy because no other food source is tested at all. GMOs take an average of 13 years to get approved. Every possible allergen is tested for in advance. It is just a myth that GMOs can affect our digestion - no proof exists. In fact, if you have auto-immune disorders or digestion issues, GMO foods are the safest choice. The vast majority of what someone thinks was a GMO that affected their health are not in fact GMO sourced foods. There are only 3 GMO produce items in markets and most GMOs are grown for farm animal feed, ethanol or cotton. GMO sourced refined sweeteners and oils are no longer allowed to be labeled as GMO because they become pure when refined so the organic sourced versions are chemically identical.

Jurors are not scientist!!!!! Glyphosate does not cause Hodgkin's Lymphoma!!! The IARC which a division of the World Health Organization which is what you are talking about said in March of 2015 that Glyphosate was probably a carcinogenic. They also said that beer, coffee, cell phones, aloe vera, pickled vegetables, fried chicken, and sunlight were also probably carcinogenic. They agreed that Glyphosate is the safest herbicides that farmers have ever used. In fact the LD 50 number which is the ratings used all the world to measure toxicity with the HIGHER the number the LOWER the toxicity. To show how low a toxicity Glyphosate has here are some examples. Nicotine 9 caffeine 192 Tylenol 338 Codeine 427 2-4-D 665 OFF for mosquitoes 1014 Table salt 3000 Vinegar 3300 Baking Soda 4220 Roundup(Glyphosate) 5600.
Out of many many many herbicides that farmers can use on gmo crops GLYPHOSATE is by far the SAFEST of them ALL. Can you name one herbicide that is safer than GLYPHOSATE? Glyphosate is even safer than many of the pesticides that Organic growers use. Glyphosate is applied at specific rate and no more just like all the other herbicides that Farmers use

This is over and the fact that Bayer settled without admitting guilt of any kind will go down in history. The follow-up will be exposing the root cause of this hoax - A $160,000 cash bribe to the IARC.

It Is cheaper to just settle instead of paying all the lawyer fees then the frivolous lawsuits will be over. It will be just like the Syngenta lawsuits. Syngenta did wrong Bayer and the former Monsanto has done nothing wrong. There are many companies even foreign companies producing and selling Glyphosate(Roundup).

The IARC which a division of the World Health Organization which is what you are talking about said in March of 2015 that Glyphosate(Roundup) was probably a carcinogenic. They also said that beer, coffee, cell phones, aloe vera, pickled vegetables, fried chicken, and sunlight were also probably carcinogenic. They agreed that Roundup(Glyphosate) is the safest herbicides that farmers have ever used. In fact the LD 50 number which is the ratings used all the world to measure toxicity with the HIGHER the number the LOWER the toxicity. To show how low a toxicity Roundup (Glyphosate) has here are some examples. Nicotine 9 caffeine 192 Tylenol 338 Codeine 427 2-4-D 665 OFF for mosquitoes 1014 Table salt 3000 Vinegar 3300 Baking Soda 4220 Roundup(Glyphosate) 5600.
Out of many many many herbicides that farmers can use on gmo crops GLYPHOSATE(ROUNDUP) is by far the SAFEST of them ALL. Can you name one herbicide that is safer than ROUNDUP (GLYPHOSATE)? Glyphosate(Roundup) is even safer than many of the pesticides that Organic growers use. Glyphosate(Roundup) is applied at specific rate and no more just like all the other herbicides that Farmers use.

So despite the documented bribe, hundreds of shyster lawyers opened cases based on a false premise that glyphosate could cause cancers This started in liberal California where cancer warning labels are required on coffee. Bayer bought out Monsanto 3 years ago so it had to take over the lawsuits. The Bayer AG division could not shake of this pack of lawyers and their thousands of fake lawsuits so it paid out a final group settlement with NO admission of any guilt, no admission that Roundup could cause cancer, because it can not and did not.

Almost is clueless when it comes to pesticides and their labels. ALL pesticides have always had labels on them with the Signal word. Signal words are the first word in large print found on pesticide product labels, and they describe the acute toxicity of the formulated pesticide product so you know what you are dealing with before you read the label.. The signal word can be either: DANGER, WARNING or CAUTION. DANGER being very toxic and CAUTION no toxicity. The first word on a glyphosate(Roundup) label is CAUTION. The one thing about Almost is He keeps spewing out his garbage which gives me a chance to show the ignorance in his comment for public to see. Almost has been huge help in promoting the pure safety of gmo technology. You and I could not educate so many people without the help of this clown from Russia.

I vouch for David as a semi-retired farmer who knows his stuff. You ignored my reply so here it is again - There are hundreds of types of GMO seed for addressing many different challenges farmers have. More than half of all GMO seeds being used today (by variety, not tonnage) are not for or from US agribusiness. They are for specific applications in many different parts of the world where climate change is causing additional challenges like drought, floods, extreme temperatures, pests, blights or salty soils. Most of them are not patented. Most of them are not glyphosate tolerant and some need no pesticides at all. Most of them are given away free to struggling farmers by NGOs and govt seed programs.

Your post is FALSE. Regular Bt corn does NOT produce the same protein as did Starlink corn. Starlink corn was brought on to the market in 1998 after receiving approval for animal use which was a huge huge HUGE mistake because ALL other gmo technology crops wait until it is approved for both animals and humans before bringing them to the market. Starlink was quickly recall and cost the company Atventis Dearly. It was a good learning lesson for the GMO technology industry that happened 23 years ago. The lesson is in the production of bulk commodities It cost money to keep them separate and you can not keep them separate unless you are paid a huge premium like We are paid to raise NON GMO crops then they can be kept seperate.

Starlink produces a diferent protein than does Bt corn. Yes BT is BT is BT IS BT and BT and the same BT has been used by Organic growers for decades. BT has been proven harmless to humans. Bt gmo technology is now being use in Europe as in all over the world. Organic growers have used Bt for decades even injecting some food with Bt. I am sure you have heard of Bt corn. Bt corn contains naturally occurring Bacillus thuringiensis bacteria, a result of recombinant DNA techniques. that selectively kill caterpillar pest. Organic growers have for decades approved sprays containing Bt, a naturally occurring soil bacterium. Bt produces biotoxins lethal to moths,caterpillars and butterflies when ingested. Because it targets these insects' intestinal membranes(ABSENT in HUMANS and ANIMALS ), the EPA considers it benign to non- caterpillar species, including beneficial insects. When Organic growers spray Bt they kill all moths,caterpillars, and butterflies but we do not do that with gmo corn because only corn bore and corn rootworms attacks corn so they are the only insects affected. For 80 years farmers like me used dangerous dangerous pesticides to control theses insects but today we do not have to use them thanks to gmo technology. GMO technology is safer for my children, my Wife, our water, our farm, and our environment.

False. You are trying to speak in absolutes. It is an understood fact that all farming is invasive to nature. We have not cleared much new farmland in the last 50 years but we greatly increased output per acre and GMO crop science comes closest to perpetual sustainability where it is used, many regions of the world still use stone age farming practices which can be improved on greatly. Crop technology WILL save us from technology created issues. This has already started.

You made a huge blunder by ignoring the common widely accepted definitions of those. You are alone in your odd interpretations. In the USA, and at Youtube, organic is defined by our USDA organic standard. It excludes GMO crop science - stupidly, but that is the fact. GMO, or OGM in some languages, is internationally understood to mean laboratory altered DNA and anyone trying to change the established global definition is being foolish. You thought you were being clever but it backfired.

'Almost' JUST POSTED HIS 178th BLATANT BALD FACED LIE ABOUT HUMAN SAFETY TESTING. THIS IS REFUTATION NUMBER 178 COMPLETE WITH HYPERLINK OF PROOF THAT PROVES THE '[USER 89]' TROLL IS LYING FOR THE 178th TIME: Human safety feeding trials study, including quantified human risk assessment, that trolls say do not exist: Golden rice is designed to make a change in the human body with Vit. A. This is an exception to most GMO foods so Codex compliant human testing was done. Here is the study that verified the human safety and nutrition trials: ncbi dot nlm dot nih dot gov/pmc/articles/ PMC2682994/ Note that only one serving per person was required to verify the proper nutrition from golden rice. Additional servings would be a waste of time, as determined by multiple safety agencies who peer reviewed the process.
"So "why don't we do clinical trials on GMOs the same way we do for drugs?" Drugs are designed to cause a change in the human body: that's the whole point behind them. Since drugs are altering something in humans, it's important to know the side-effects that they may cause and whether or not they're causing the anticipated effect (i.e. is it better than placebo). In contrast, GMOs are designed to be equivalent to their non-GE counterparts: they aren't drugs or nutritional supplements." geneticliteracyproject[dot]org/2016/01/13/ no-long-term-gmo -studies-humans/

Fact Check - CLAIM - 'Bill Gates has openly admitted that vaccinations are designed so that governments can depopulate the world.'
FALSE
"On 21 January 2016, dubious news and conspiracy theory site YourNewsWire dot com published a story with the headline “Bill Gates Admits ‘Vaccines Are Best Way To Depopulate’”. The article opens with a damning claim:
"Bill Gates has openly admitted that vaccinations are designed so that governments can depopulate the world.
"
To support this claim, the site presented a February 2011 clip of Bill Gates being interviewed by CNN’s Sanjay Gupta about his foundation’s vaccination efforts:
>"Dr. Sanjay Gupta: Ten billion dollars over the next 10 years to make it “the year of the vaccines.” What does that mean exactly?
Bill Gates: Over this decade, we believe unbelievable progress can be made, in both inventing new vaccines and making sure they get out to all the children who need them. […] we only need about six or seven more — and then you would have all the tools to reduce childhood death, reduce population growth, and everything — the stability, the environment — benefits from that."<
To make sure the point was not lost on the reader, YNW repeated the “reduce population growth”, emphasized above, numerous times at a variety of different playback speeds, as if to suggest this was a slip of the tongue revealing some nefarious secret. This narrative is reinforced with another video that opens with this text:
Next are two short excerpts from a recently filmed TED presentation (Feb 2010) by none other than Bill “Microsoft” Gates. […] As Gates casually addresses the issue [of reducing carbon emissions], he goes on to state that one way to accomplish this goal is to reduce the global human population.
In the first clip you will hear him state in plain language that he considers VACCINES to be desirable to that end. You will also casually hear him promoting HEALTH CARE and REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES, to accomplish that same goal.
In the second excerpt you will hear Gates again confirming his profound affection for vaccines. The damming moment, according to YourNewsWire dot com, was the following statement from Gates: "First, we’ve got population. The world today has 6.8 billion people. That’s headed up to about nine billion. Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by, perhaps, 10 or 15 percent […]."
The suggestion, hinted at by both of these clips and argued later in the article, is that Gates knows vaccines are dangerous — and he is using this information to kill children in the developing world to stem population growth. In reality, however, Gates’ statements regarding vaccines and population growth were neither an accidental slip nor a nefarious admission of plans for a new world order.
As discussed in a 21 November 2011 Forbes cover story profiling the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, reducing population growth has always been integral to their stated mission of “improving people’s health and giving them the chance to lift themselves out of hunger and extreme poverty”:
In 1997, when he and Melinda first ventured into public health […] they focused on birth control, funding a Johns Hopkins effort to use computers to help women in the developing world learn about contraception. The logic was crisp and Bill Gates-friendly. Health = resources ÷ people. And since resources, as Gates noted, are relatively fixed, the answer lay in population control.
As further discussed in this piece, Gates later came to the conclusion that birth control was not the best approach to achieve the goal of slower population growth, instead realizing that — counterintuitively — a reduction in childhood mortality was the best way to limit population growth:
In society after society, he saw, when the mortality rate falls—specifically, below 10 deaths per 1,000 people—the birth rate follows, and population growth stabilizes. “It goes against common sense,” Gates says. Most parents don’t choose to have eight children because they want to have big families, it turns out, but because they know many of their children will die.
“If a mother and father know their child is going to live to adulthood, they start to naturally reduce their population size,” says Melinda. snopes[dot]com/fact-check/bill-gates-vaccinations-depopulation/

5) The fact that the ISAA lists GMO crops separately is totally benign and has no negative connotations whatsoever! This moron thinks it means something. It does not, nor does the ISAA imply there are any additional risks with GMO foods. It endorses the high value of GMO crop science.
6) False premise!! GMO seed is not sold primarily to increase yields, it is to reduce risks from pests and extreme conditions while using less pesticides. Yields are far more stable since farmers don't have to worry about many of the usual issues that can DROP yields, investing in GMO seed is a form of crop insurance with a guaranteed benefit. When you use little to no pesticides at all, your FINANCIAL YIELDS are far greater in the form of profits! Same bushels per acre, more profits.

Off topic nonsense. How can you not grasp that industrial accidents have nothing to do with the safety of GMO foods for consumers?

Not one single food we farm is as it was in the beginning because we saw much room for improvement and we still do. If we listened to ignorant fools like you there would be no cauliflower, broccoli, kale, turnips, brussels sprouts, or other cruciferous vegetables, we'd still only have the original wild mustard plant.

The Seralini quack has been completely debunked and ejected from the scientific community for his lies about GMOs and rats. For starters, he used a species of lab rat known to always grow many tumors by age one no matter what it is fed! The EU launched a massive campaign 6 years ago to either verify or disprove all of Seralini's claims from his organic farmer funded fake lab in France. Results? Not a single claim could be verified or reproduced, all study methods were found to be extremely faulty and misleading. Seralini will go down in history as the top anti-GMO fraud of this century!

Irony!! YOU are pretending to be an expert when you are nothing but a pawn for anti-biotech groups who are all funded from one source. The true story of corn is that several huge civilizations thrived with it. The true story of corn is ABSOLUTELY NOT 'psudo science' (which is not even a real word because you spelled it wrong). Wheat and rice are the only two foods consumed more than corn by humans. Stop pretending you know anything. Dubai harbors terrorists and highly sexist people still stuck in a stone age religion. Neil is a world class scientists who far out qualifies anyone in that country.

"Maize, called corn in the United States, is a staple food throughout most of the world, including among these farmers in Venda, South Africa. Maize is eaten by itself, and used for products such as sweeteners, breads, and cornmeal. A food staple is a food that makes up the dominant part of a population's diet."

I know all about teosinte, the wild source for all corn today. It was popcorn, only about 20 kernels per 2 inch ear. This thread is about GMOs and not about your agendas against various sweeteners that were all grown and marketed from conventional breeding for decades before the first GMOs. The 10,000 year history is ABSOLUTELY RELEVANT when you try to post some bullshit lie. The history proves you wrong, period. It is in fact YOU who is posting pseudoscience trash.
I am nobody special, I respond to insults against our honest hard working farmers and crop scientists. I am up against a $3 billion dollar annual propaganda campaign.

God you are stupid. Most GMOs are NOT glyphosate tolerant but that is an extremely desirable and environmentally friendly trait that farmers asked for and farmers love because they know how great it is to use less pesticides of a less toxic nature.

*Pesticides don’t pose acute health risk to honeybees foraging on farmland, two-year study finds
*
Jon Zawislak | Insects | September 12, 2019
This investigation examined two types of landscapes within a two-mile (3.2 km) radius of honey bee colonies: an intensive agricultural setting and a rural setting without intensive agriculture. More than 10,000 acres of agricultural land was surveyed to quantify the area of cultivated crops and the area treated with pesticides, including seed treatments and foliar applications of insecticides. Samples of honey, bee bread (stored pollen), beeswax, and adult bees were collected from hives in both landscape types and screened for pesticide residues to determine if foraging bees were transporting pesticides to hives. Some samples of bee bread and honey did contain pesticide residues, but these were below known lethal dose (LD50) levels for honey bees. Recent declines in honey bee populations cannot be attributed to any one single cause, but are likely the result of accumulated stresses from multiple causes. The complex of the mite Varroa destructor and the viruses they vector continues to be the greatest threat to honey bee health. Other pathogens such as Nosema ceranae also affect honey bee health, productivity, and survivorship. Additionally, bees must have access to adequate nutrition from floral resources in order to maintain health. Most likely, a combination of multiple factors, including these and others, are responsible for recent declines in honey bee health and populations. Optimal management of honey bee colonies must include a reduction of multiple stress factors, including sublethal exposure to pesticides, and discussions of honey bee health should not be limited to a narrow focus on pesticide exposure.

Thank goodness FDA and EPA testing of foods no longer finds dangerous levels of Atrazine, paraquat, DDT, fludioxonil, metolaclor, acephate and diazinon. Now they find minute traces of the least toxic herbicide ever formulated, glyphosate, which is 43% less toxic than table salt, and Bt, so non-toxic that organic farmers rely on it heavily. WHAT A DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENT!!!! Anti-GMO idiots claim they want to go back to that nightmare list of much more toxic pesticides. Why???? I can't imagine.

There is no legitimate evidence found by peer reviewed studies that even hint at any negative health effects of the Bt trait which has been used by organic farmers for 40 years. THE ONLY 'sensitive population' to Bt is borer worm pests. Bt has no effect on any other living thing.

Neil is correct in the contest of use of layman's terms for a general audience. The above video is not a college level biology lecture. Nature has been causing random bizarre mutations daily for 4 billion years. Life depends on mutations of every sort to evolve. Nothing about genetic mutations is bad, regardless of the cause of them. Just as nature uses natural selection to weed out its less desirable or successful mutations, GMO labs test the hell out of every single mutation they produce. It takes many years and 75 tests mandated by our FDA, USDA & EPA before any GMO is approved. No exceptions - ever.

What is not tested, ever, for safety?? Organic, heirloom, hybrid and new truck farm breeds. They go straight to store shelves with zero testing and YOU are the guinea pig. Look at what has happened because of this fact that never happened with GMO foods: "A year ago[2003] in New Zealand, there was an outbreak of food poisoning from a "killer zucchini" that hospitalized a number of people. Environmentalists jumped all over the story until it was determined that the culprit was "organic" zucchini. Plants are chemical factories that produce a multitude of toxins that protect them. An outbreak of aphid infestation had minimal impact on conventionally grown zucchini. The more vulnerable "organic" zucchini was genetically inferior because of inbreeding. They expressed dangerously high levels of the toxin curcubitan. Had this been a transgenic plant, we would be hearing about it ad nauseam, but being that it was "organic," it was quickly consigned to an Orwellian memory hole."

AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH
--------------------------------
Don’t buy organic food if you want to increase farm yields or seriously address climate change
"As we approach the 2020s, many consumers have accepted the marketing/activist narrative that organic farming would be the best option for food safety and to mitigate the most damaging effects of climate change. The inconvenient truth is that organic farming is a terrible option from a climate change perspective. Its dependence on manures and compost involves huge, but rarely recognized, greenhouse gas emissions in the form of very potent methane and nitrous oxide.
But perhaps its biggest climate change issue is that organic farms are mostly less productive per unit area than “conventionally” farmed land. With rising food demand driven mostly by rising standards of living in the developing world, there is a need to boost farm production, and that means the very undesirable conversion of forests or grasslands to agriculture in places like Brazil. That leads to major carbon dioxide release from what had been sequestered carbon in the soils, and also the loss of biodiversity and other environmental services provided by those natural lands.
In 1990, the USDA (US Department of Agriculture) was charged by Congress with establishing a national organic standard to supersede the fragmented certification systems that had evolved to that time. It was a major struggle because the very science-oriented USDA was at odds with the early organic marketers who had focused entirely on the narrative that what is “natural” is always best. The marketers finally prevailed. When the national organic standards were issued in 2002, they were not based on science but rather on the naturalistic fallacy. So here is the big picture. The only crop category for which organic yields were higher than the 2016 US average was for forage crops for feeding animals. To have produced all of the US agricultural output from 2016 as organic would have required more than 100 million more acres to have been farmed—an area greater than that of the entire state of California, the third largest US state. That amount of new land suitable for farming clearly does not exist in the US, and so that shortfall would induce more conversion of forest and grassland into farming in places like Brazil, leading to major releases of previously sequestered carbon in those soils"
This informative article goes on to use [USER 779] charts and graphs from government data to prove in great detail just how inferior organic farming is.

The link this science illiterate nut job left is not to peer reviewed research. It is a blog from a college site that offers no citations of proof. Resistance has been a challenge to farmers ever since the first pesticides were used, and no change in the level of pest resistance challenges has happened since GMO crop science. In fact. we are producing more GMO crops with resistance strategies that can completely conquer pest resistance for the first time in human history by offering annual rotations between glyphosate resistant, 2,4-D resistant and RNAi resistant crops. There is also a recommended strategy for Bt resistance control that the article did not mention:

You are not 'implying' anything but your extreme science illiteracy and a failure to detect organic industry operatives.
Organic industry tyranny for 32 years and counting: "Although GMOs are regarded as safe as their conventional counterparts by every major food safety authority in the world, the organic industry spends nearly $3 billion a year through over 330 different organizations leading with fear and “information spin” as an industry to sell their products. By creating an unfounded fear that requires tighter regulations on GMO crops, they are hoping to force them out of the food supply, thereby creating a bigger market share to sell more products in their more than $65 billion wheelhouse.
The unfortunate consequence of these [non-GMO] labels is that the food companies and lobbyists tend to create an unnecessary “us vs. them” divide. When food companies use fear against competitors to sell a product, farmers take it personally."

Now why do you suppose organic food is so expensive?? Imagine what 3 billion dollars could do for humanitarian goals - end a different disease forever every year.... End all hunger in at least one country...... Funding nasty propaganda? Really??

The Youtube professional fraud Jeffry Smith, who claims to be in charge of his "Institute for Responsible Technology" which is nothing but a computer on his home desk, has been spreading absurd fabrications and fake 'reports' about GMO foods and glyphosate.
"Meanwhile, plant geneticist Dr. Wayne Parrott - professor of crop science at the University of Georgia - claimed
the report relied on "a handful of deeply flawed" studies and did not reference the "more than 1,000 studies that
have been published in refereed journals and which show that GM crops are as safe as their counterparts."
-- Levels of glyphosate exposure required are highly unrealistic
--
Citing studies using poultry and cows, the IRT report claims that glyphosate is known to kill beneficial gut
bacteria, but not pathogenic varieties such as E. coli, salmonella, and botulism. This can create overgrowth of
harmful gut bacteria in the intestines, which can produce a substance that can create gaps in the junction
between cells along the intestinal wall and allow the contents of the intestines to enter the bloodstream—also
known as permeable or “leaky” gut, which is frequently seen in gluten-sensitive patients, it claims.
But Dr. Parrott said the amount of glyphosate required to alter gut bacteria as claimed by Smith would be at "a
level thousands of time higher than will eventually end up as residues in the food supply. The levels Smith cites
are not 'minimal' by any measure," he said.
"Smith goes on to cite a study claiming that glyphosate alters retinoic acid metabolism. According to the study
cited, glyphosate does indeed alter retinoic acid metabolism, if the stuff gets injected straight into an embryo.
The mode of exposure is so unrealistic that table salt, aspirin or just about anything could probably give similar
results. Last but not least, the description by Smith of 'GMOs soaked with glyphosate' is a blatant distortion of the
facts," he added.*

Horseshit ignorance. They would all perish in that situation. Increasing populations on a planet with deteriorating climate conditions means mass starvation without GMO crop science. GMOs allow farmers to preserve the land while doing more with fewer resources, and help us address today's most pressing environmental challenges.
"When determining the environmental impact of GMOs vs non-GMOs in agriculture, consider the ability for GMOs to preserve biodiversity. GM crops increase productivity on existing agricultural land and protect biodiversity by sparing lands not intensively cultivated. Through enhanced adoption of conservation tillage practices, the reduction of insecticide use, and the use of more environmentally benign herbicides that increase yields, GM agriculture has alleviated pressure to convert additional land into agricultural use.
GMOs can increase productivity in agriculture. According to PG Economics, from 1996 to 2017, GMO crops are estimated to have contributed to an additional global production of 213.47 million tons of soybeans, 404.91 million tons of corn, 27.47 million tons of cotton lint and 11.65 million tons of canola. GM crops have contributed to higher yields, e.g., 30% more in some farming areas, and can contribute to poverty reduction and food security in developing countries.
GMOs can reduce soil erosion. Herbicide tolerant (HT) crops enable more farmers to adopt conservation tillage because they help farmers to more effectively and efficiently control weeds at a lower cost. Florida farmer Lawson Mozley explains that with herbicide tolerant GM crops, weeds can be sprayed and remain in the field to protect the soil. Then the incoming crop is planted directly into the leftover organic matter without turning over the soil.
GMOs can help conserve water. Farmers utilize many tools to conserve water including drip irrigation systems. GMOs provide another tool that farmers can employ to help conserve water. HT crops, along with conservation tillage, aid in soil moisture retention, which can reduce the need to irrigate. GMOs can help reduce water use in another way – drought tolerance. This GM trait can help crops cope with stress and allow farmers to increase yields when periods of drought occur – without supplemental water from irrigation.
GMOs can help improve air quality. GMOs can reduce agriculturally-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Agricultural economist Graham Brookes reports: GMOs have helped farmers reduce their environmental footprint by allowing them to use fewer inputs and enabling a shift to reduced tillage. These practices have led to less time spent on a tractor, less fuel used and fewer emissions. As a result, GMOs have helped reduce CO2 emissions equivalent to removing nearly 16.7 million cars from the road for one year. They have also led to nearly 1.48 billion pounds of less pesticides being applied between 1996 and 2016.
GMOs can lead to fewer pesticide applications. A common misconception is that the adoption of GM crops have increased the use of pesticides when just the opposite is true. Overall GM crops, including crops with the “Bt” (Bacillus thuringiensis) trait for insect resistance, have contributed to an 8% decrease in pesticide applications. Not only is this beneficial to our environment, but also to the farmers who grow the crops."

You are an extremely ignorant and backwards person who totally ignores the massive consensus of peer reviewed science and our population emergency. We stopped ruining soils decades ago. We now live in closer harmony with beneficial insects by crop science that targets only one specific crop pest. Farmers can't "put chickens" in 500 acre farms. We choose to use pesticides to avoid mass starvation on a global scale you moron. Indian deaths from pesticides are dropping in number as they switch to GMO crop science. Just stop posting hateful lies that insult real farmers everywhere. This is very bad karma you spread. Look what GMO eggplant is doing to help Bangladesh farmers - Indian farmers rioted in their streets in 2019 because they want Bt GMO crops!

Telling a lie repeatedly will not make it true. You are not delighted, you stand humiliated by facts. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations site that tracks soil health and regions suitable for farming shows no recent degradation except for climate change factors like drought.
http://www.fao.org/soils-portal/soil-degradation-restoration/global-soil-health-indicators-and-assessment/global-soil-health/en/
This link above takes you to 3 maps and the home page with links for various factors. There are tabs for survey methodology, assessment, biodiversity and management.
It is absurd beyond words to suggest a modern farmer with hundreds of acres could herd several thousand chickens around his expansive fields, prevent them from eating planted seeds coated with neonicotinoid pesticides, protect them from predation without over head nets and somehow get them to pull pests off of the tops of 8 foot high corn stalks or dig up root borers effectively. You are an ignorant closed minded senile old fart.
I invite all readers to look at the link I provided to see all the green zones indicating high soil quality on the North American continent.
How you manage your hillbilly vegetable garden has nothing in common with effective management of staple crop farms on a massive scale. GMO farmers have adopted no-till and winter cover crop methods to improve soil health. It is working.

In your tiny world there are no large farms. In your tiny world there are no facts about pest resistance that has been a challenge to all farmers for the last 200 years we have used pesticides. That has not changed ans is still controlled by rotation. More than half of all GMO seeds being used today (by variety, not tonnage) are not for US agribusiness. They are for specific applications in many different parts of the world where climate change is causing additional challenges. Most of them are not patented. Most of them are given away free to struggling farmers by NGOs and govt seed programs:

That's easy - because I was told nothing. Peer reviewed science studies are simply there for anyone to learn from. This is not a pissing contest - the one with the most proof that has been verified and peer reviewed wins the debate. That's why i always win. Science is an international language. Everyone is bound by the same peer review process which includes divulging any conflicts of interest in funding. They even have their own policing force -

No! You are lying, either intentionally or because of the propaganda being fed to you by the organic thugs. You are bluffing too, no farmer would think that the Bt trait means the actual bacteria is in the seed. ONLY the very specific protein molecule that is only capable of binding to molecules in the gut linings of borer worm pests is present in Bt GMO seed and crops. This molecule is totally inert to all other living things. There is no getting around the fact that a real farmer would know this.

Organic industry tyranny for 32 years and counting:
"Although GMOs are regarded as safe as their conventional counterparts by every major food safety authority in the world, the organic industry spends nearly $3 billion a year through over 330 different organizations leading with fear and “information spin” as an industry to sell their products. By creating an unfounded fear that requires tighter regulations on GMO crops, they are hoping to force them out of the food supply, thereby creating a bigger market share to sell more products in their more than $65 billion wheelhouse.
The unfortunate consequence of these [non-GMO] labels is that the food companies and lobbyists tend to create an unnecessary “us vs. them” divide. When food companies use fear against competitors to sell a product, farmers take it personally."

ALL READERS - Go to the dot gov sites for the FDA, USDA & EPA to easily find out this asshole is a severely demented liar. Over 75 mandatory tests are required before any GMO is approved, this takes years to complete. If the producers do not provide verifiable documented evidence that all tests have been completed the seed will not be approved. The FDA does on site audits and interviews for confirmation. The FDA wrote the Codex for the world and they sure as hell are not going to violate their own guidelines. Only Trump does that. The entire world celebrates the triumph of GMO crop science.

The WHO, EPA, EFSA and 281 other agencies all affirm that GMOs and glyphosate are totally safe and cause no unintended consequences. Full global consensus! All 284 global health and safety agencies agree. Yes, this is the mother of all GMO safety citations and a stake in the heart of all anti-biotech conspiratards:

On the linked page is a hyperlink of proof for each of those 284 agencies. Some may not be in English. Only the Russians and the IARC now discredited by bribery disagree.

Insects can weaken plants by boring holes in them. This makes various infections and blights more prevalent. Pesticides include fungicides and treatments for various viral blights. GMO science can insert natural genetic traits that resist various diseases, reducing the need for pesticide treatments. Farmers love it.

Starlink was just Bt corn which is grown massively today.
"Nevertheless, many other types of Bt corn produce different pesticidal toxins that have passed extensive tests for toxicity and allergenicity. As a result, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which regulates GM foods, considers these varieties of Bt-corn to be safe and nutritionally equivalent to traditional corn, and they are currently grown on millions of acres."

GMO is a laboratory breeding method for seeds. It is never under any circumstances an actual food ingredient just as hybridization, grafting and seed selection are not food ingredients Lying organic thug trolls will try to use fear mongering to convince you GMO sourced foods are not as safe when in fact they are far safer. What is not tested, ever, for safety?? Organic, heirloom, hybrid and new truck farm breeds. They go straight to store shelves with zero testing and YOU are the guinea pig. Look at what has happened because of this fact that never happened with GMO foods: "A year ago[2003] in New Zealand, there was an outbreak of food poisoning from a "killer zucchini" that hospitalized a number of people. Environmentalists jumped all over the story until it was determined that the culprit was "organic" zucchini. Plants are chemical factories that produce a multitude of toxins that protect them. An outbreak of aphid infestation had minimal impact on conventionally grown zucchini. The more vulnerable "organic" zucchini was genetically inferior because of inbreeding. They expressed dangerously high levels of the toxin curcubitan. Had this been a transgenic plant, we would be hearing about it ad nauseam, but being that it was "organic," it was quickly consigned to an Orwellian memory hole."

We eat Bt corn today you asshole. Starlink was just Bt corn which is grown massively today.
"Nevertheless, many other types of Bt corn produce different pesticidal toxins that have passed extensive tests for toxicity and allergenicity. As a result, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which regulates GM foods, considers these varieties of Bt-corn to be safe and nutritionally equivalent to traditional corn, and they are currently grown on millions of acres."

This asshole troll is a liar. He cherry picks questionable fringe studies and articles that have been retracted. His first link Is to an ARTICLE, NOT A STUDY, FROM 2013 - ITS CLAIM HAS NOT BEEN VERIFIED! The second link's claims from 2015 have never been reproduced. Th 2017 study is from an Italian 'lab' that has cranked out many false claims - they were responsible for the cell phone + brain cancer study hoax. The Almost troll sorted through 10,000 studies to find the few outliers who use absurdly high concentrations of glyphosate that can never happen in real life. You will lose your debate to class mates who know the difference between activist nonsense and peer reviewed science consensus. Here are 8,876 per reviewed GMO safety studies the Almost troll ignores:

GMO seed is a gift to humanity when the patents expire, or from the start when non-profits donate the seed to struggling farmers.
Thank goodness FDA and EPA testing of foods no longer finds dangerous levels of Atrazine, paraquat, DDT, fludioxonil, metolaclor, acephate and diazinon. Now they find minute traces of the least toxic herbicide ever formulated, glyphosate, which is 43% less toxic than table salt, and Bt, so non-toxic that organic farmers rely on it heavily. WHAT A DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENT!!!! Anti-GMO idiots claim they want to go back to that nightmare list of much more toxic pesticides. Why???? I can't imagine.

Glyphosate can cure cancer? Yes, some research ‘shows’ that — but what does it mean? And what does it say about Roundup doomsday claims? "Now that three juries have said Bayer’s weed killer Roundup (glyphosate) causes cancer, many people believe there is clear evidence that the herbicide is dangerous. Organic industry-funded advocacy group U.S. Right to Know (USRTK) certainly wants consumers to believe that. The California-based nonprofit has played a key role in the three cases, providing evidence the plaintiffs’ lawyers have used to make their case. None of these claims stand up to scrutiny from independent scientists or oversight agencies, as GLP has reported extensively. But USRTK has employed a tactic (favored by political groups of all persuasions) in its opposition to glyphosate that is worth examining: Sifting through the peer-reviewed literature to find studies that support their argument, while dismissing contradictory research—widely known as “cherry picking.”
Selectively citing studies can lead to erroneous conclusions, which is why scientists criticize the practice and insist on evaluating all the available research, a standard known as “preponderance of evidence.” But if you want to show that glyphosate is dangerous, despite a mountain of contrary data, picking cherries is a useful approach.
To illustrate how easy it is to defend an unsubstantiated hypothesis, and why we should be skeptical of sensational claims about chemical harm or safety, let’s “demonstrate” that glyphosate might be a ‘cure’ for cancer by highlighting only the research that helps make the case. Over the past several years, a handful of studies published in peer-reviewed journals and conducted by researchers at reputable universities has in fact suggested that glyphosate possesses cancer-fighting properties. The first such study was published in 2013. Researchers exposed human cancer cells in-vitro, or outside their normal biological context, to glyphosate and AMPA (the degradation product produced when glyphosate is metabolized). The experiment showed both substances inhibited cancer cell growth and promoted apoptosis (cell suicide), but left healthy cells unharmed, “…. suggesting that they have [potential] to be developed into a new anticancer therapy,” the authors concluded.
The researchers published a followup study in 2015 and got a similar result. They exposed human prostate cancer cell lines to AMPA and a chemical called methoxyacetic acid (MAA), concluding that both chemicals could “…. be used as potential therapeutic drugs in the treatment of prostate cancer.”
Glyphosate testing in animals hints at therapeutic potential
In a 2016 study, the research team that found potentially therapeutic effects of glyphosate tested their thesis in animals. They exposed 25 mice to two different doses of AMPA. Compared to a control group of 14 mice, the experiment revealed that “….treatment significantly inhibited growth and metastasis of …. prostate tumors and prolonged the survival time of the mice.” Summarizing their findings, the authors wrote:
[T]hese results demonstrate that …. AMPA may be developed into a therapeutic agent for the treatment of prostate cancer.
Adding another interesting piece of data to the equation, consumer products company Procter & Gamble owns the patent on a pharmaceutical drug that contains glyphosate as an active ingredient and is designed to kill colon, breast and lung human tumor cells. According to the company, glyphosate in combination with a plant growth regulator called chloroprofam was “…. effective in killing tumor cells without significantly affecting healthy cells.” The unmarketed drug is potentially very interesting because it targeted cancer cells specifically and was also effective against viruses including HIV, herpes and influenza."

GMO is a laboratory breeding method for seeds. It is never under any circumstances an actual food ingredient just as hybridization, grafting and seed selection are not food ingredients Lying organic thug trolls will try to use fear mongering to convince you GMO sourced foods are not as safe when in fact they are far safer. What is not tested, ever, for safety?? Organic, heirloom, hybrid and new truck farm breeds. They go straight to store shelves with zero testing and YOU are the guinea pig. Look at what has happened because of this fact that never happened with GMO foods: "A year ago[2003] in New Zealand, there was an outbreak of food poisoning from a "killer zucchini" that hospitalized a number of people. Environmentalists jumped all over the story until it was determined that the culprit was "organic" zucchini. Plants are chemical factories that produce a multitude of toxins that protect them. An outbreak of aphid infestation had minimal impact on conventionally grown zucchini. The more vulnerable "organic" zucchini was genetically inferior because of inbreeding. They expressed dangerously high levels of the toxin curcubitan. Had this been a transgenic plant, we would be hearing about it ad nauseam, but being that it was "organic," it was quickly consigned to an Orwellian memory hole."

You are proving my point. If you understood crop science you would already know that no new plants are being created. All GMO enhanced plants have already been eaten for over 10,000 years - is that enough testing? Your education is a complete failure! You dare to claim you are smarter than the global consensus. The WHO, EPA, EFSA and 281 other agencies all affirm that GMOs and glyphosate are totally safe and cause no unintended consequences. Full global consensus!

Glyphosate can cure cancer? Yes, some research ‘shows’ that — but what does it mean? And what does it say about Roundup doomsday claims?
"Now that three juries have said Bayer’s weed killer Roundup (glyphosate) causes cancer, many people believe there is clear evidence that the herbicide is dangerous. Organic industry-funded advocacy group U.S. Right to Know (USRTK) certainly wants consumers to believe that. The California-based nonprofit has played a key role in the three cases, providing evidence the plaintiffs’ lawyers have used to make their case. None of these claims stand up to scrutiny from independent scientists or oversight agencies, as GLP has reported extensively. But USRTK has employed a tactic (favored by political groups of all persuasions) in its opposition to glyphosate that is worth examining: Sifting through the peer-reviewed literature to find studies that support their argument, while dismissing contradictory research—widely known as “cherry picking.”
Selectively citing studies can lead to erroneous conclusions, which is why scientists criticize the practice and insist on evaluating all the available research, a standard known as “preponderance of evidence.” But if you want to show that glyphosate is dangerous, despite a mountain of contrary data, picking cherries is a useful approach.
To illustrate how easy it is to defend an unsubstantiated hypothesis, and why we should be skeptical of sensational claims about chemical harm or safety, let’s “demonstrate” that glyphosate might be a ‘cure’ for cancer by highlighting only the research that helps make the case. Over the past several years, a handful of studies published in peer-reviewed journals and conducted by researchers at reputable universities has in fact suggested that glyphosate possesses cancer-fighting properties. The first such study was published in 2013. Researchers exposed human cancer cells in-vitro, or outside their normal biological context, to glyphosate and AMPA (the degradation product produced when glyphosate is metabolized). The experiment showed both substances inhibited cancer cell growth and promoted apoptosis (cell suicide), but left healthy cells unharmed, “…. suggesting that they have [potential] to be developed into a new anticancer therapy,” the authors concluded.
The researchers published a followup study in 2015 and got a similar result. They exposed human prostate cancer cell lines to AMPA and a chemical called methoxyacetic acid (MAA), concluding that both chemicals could “…. be used as potential therapeutic drugs in the treatment of prostate cancer.”
Glyphosate testing in animals hints at therapeutic potential
In a 2016 study, the research team that found potentially therapeutic effects of glyphosate tested their thesis in animals. They exposed 25 mice to two different doses of AMPA. Compared to a control group of 14 mice, the experiment revealed that “….treatment significantly inhibited growth and metastasis of …. prostate tumors and prolonged the survival time of the mice.” Summarizing their findings, the authors wrote:
[T]hese results demonstrate that …. AMPA may be developed into a therapeutic agent for the treatment of prostate cancer.
Adding another interesting piece of data to the equation, consumer products company Procter & Gamble owns the patent on a pharmaceutical drug that contains glyphosate as an active ingredient and is designed to kill colon, breast and lung human tumor cells. According to the company, glyphosate in combination with a plant growth regulator called chloroprofam was “…. effective in killing tumor cells without significantly affecting healthy cells.” The unmarketed drug is potentially very interesting because it targeted cancer cells specifically and was also effective against viruses including HIV, herpes and influenza."

So you can not answer a simple question and Glyphosate is the only word you know? That is pitiful ignorance! Many of the highly toxic pesticides Organic growers use are much much more toxic than Glyphosate. Without pesticides food production would drop 42 percent in the world.

GMO technology is about farmers like me using much much less pesticides and much much safer pesticides with the pesticides even safer than many of the pesticides that Organic growers use. The CBS Evening News had a piece 8-30-2017 on how gmo technology was being use to cure some cancers. They showed exactly how is being done and they are also working on other cancers trying to cure them. Man has been breeding plants in all different ways for thousands of years to help benefit mankind. 500 years ago a carrot was pure white. GMO technology is use in many things to better the world. Almost all Insulin used today by diabetics is GMO insulin. GMO rennet has been used for decades to make cheese. The cheese making enzyme breaks down proteins and separates them from whey. Golden Rice to benefit vitamin A-deficient children. & BT CORN AND COTTON. GMO proteins include blood- clotting factors to help Hemophiliacs, the hepatitis B vaccine, thyroid hormones, laundry detergent enzymes, and many synthetically produced amino acids used in nutritional supplements. There are many many many more benefits of GMO technologies. We all should give thanks to GOD for giving us the wisdom of GMO and stand up to those that tell lies about GOD's blessings trying to play GOD themselves trying to take away his blessings.

FROM WIKIPEDIA:
Fallacy of GMO claims about Raoultella planticola
Public testimony of Ingham and others claims of "worldwide plant death" attracted attention from the scientific community. They were unable to find any evidence that Dr Ingham had submitted her assertions about threats to terrestrial plant life to scientific publication in a peer-reviewed journal, and no evidence was found to indicate the U.S. EPA or U.S. Dept. of Agriculture had reviewed or approved any trials for SDF20[clarification needed]. Additionally, the SDF20 was found to have produce 20 micrograms per milliliter of alcohol in the soil which is several hundred times lower than that required to affect plant growth. [28]
Elaine Ingham has issued a public apology for submitting false claims about ecological impact of GMOs. [29]
The Green Party of New Zealand has issued a public apology for misleading statements and acknowledging that a cited research was never published. [30]

You are an idiot. We have not "killed" soil. All farming of every type is invasive to nature so don't be a hypocrite, you need food to live. You are the joke wallowing in the naturalistic fallacy.

No need for organic foods to be labelled to tell you when they are breed with radiation induced mutagenesis, 2400 organic crops owe their origin to Mutagenesis. Why do you only want gmo technology crops and any products that sources any ingredient derived from a gmo technology crops to be labeled? We all have a right to know don't we? NO FOOD-SAFETY SCIENCE INSTITUTIONS or COUNTRY has FELT the NEED to and has NEVER RATIFIED, NEVER EMBRACED, NEVER ADHERED TO the CODEX ALIMENTARIUS ,DO HUMAN TESTING For GMO technology and Organic foods that are breed with radiation induced mutagenesis ? They are FREE to do so if they so wish to. What country are you from [USER 90] that you are ashamed of? Are you a lying Russian Troll?

Myth of a cancer connection with glyphosate - Debunking of gullible activists and Youtube flunkies referring to two and ONLY TWO sources that claimed there was a cancer risk, BOTH have been discredited for fraud and bribery, leaving NO SCIENTIFIC SOURCE for that malicious claim. Fraud number one - Seralini rat torture:
https://allianceforscience.cornell.edu/blog/2018/06/european-studies-disprove-seralinis-gmo-maize-tumor-claims/
Fraud number two - Organic farmers sent a $160,000 cash bribe to the IARC through a corrupt USRTK lawyer to get them to make the low cancer risk statement about glyphosate. It was the cornerstone of all these shyster lawyer Roundup lawsuits but now that Congress has cut off its $2mill annual finding to the IARC they are in deep doodoo. Citations:

https://geneticliteracyproject.org/2018/08/06/congressional-committee-cuts-funding-to-iarc-over-who-agencys-controversial-glyphosate-cancer-finding/
Ironically, the kind of cancer these liars claimed was caused by glyphosate has dropped in frequency and deaths during the same era we began eating GMO foods:

No you fool, no farmer would buy that seed UNLESS it was proven to be a money saver and high yield crop in the long run. Farmers do know what they are doing, their survival and profession depends on that.
But obviously no such thing exists in reality. There is no "special fertilizer" and you can not link any proof of that because it is a lie. Profit is never a valid talking point, nobody works for free. Farmers buy the seed they want, and nothing else.
A common meme we all hear if we are exposed to lying activist sites and videos is that the Monsanto boogeyman and "corporations" want to "control the world's seed supply". Let's ponder that for a moment which is all it takes to realize how absurd and ignorant that meme really is. All the corporate seed companies combined comprise less than 20% of our global seed supply. A partial list of the plethora of supply sources they can never touch: free NGO and government run seed programs, seed banks and vaults, seed exchanges, seed libraries, neighbors swapping seed, farm granges, online seed sales, small local farm supply stores, gardening supply stores, collecting seed from wild sources, countries like Mexico where GMO seed is rejected, China with its own GMO and conventional seed programs, Asshole Russia with their anti-GMO troll armies, seed saving practices, remote villages who never have and never will buy seed, and mountain terrace farmers at the ends of 200 kilometer long foot paths in mountainous regions of three continents. Are corporate seed sellers going to march jack booted thugs up those paths with packs full of seed they will force the remote villages to buy?? Myth busted!

'Almost' JUST POSTED HIS 149th BLATANT BALD FACED LIE ABOUT HUMAN SAFETY TESTING. THIS IS REFUTATION NUMBER 149 COMPLETE WITH HYPERLINKS OF PROOF THAT PROVES THE '[USER 89]' TROLL IS LYING FOR THE 14th TIME: Human safety feeding trials study, including quantified human risk assessment, that trolls say do not exist: Golden rice is designed to make a change in the human body with Vit. A. This is an exception to most GMO foods so Codex compliant human testing was done. Here is the study that verified the human safety and nutrition trials: ncbi dot nlm dot nih dot gov/pmc/articles/ PMC2682994/ Note that only one serving per person was required to verify the proper nutrition from golden rice. Additional servings would be a waste of time, as determined by multiple safety agencies who peer reviewed the process.
"So "why don't we do clinical trials on GMOs the same way we do for drugs?" Drugs are designed to cause a change in the human body: that's the whole point behind them. Since drugs are altering something in humans, it's important to know the side-effects that they may cause and whether or not they're causing the anticipated effect (i.e. is it better than placebo). In contrast, GMOs are designed to be equivalent to their non-GE counterparts: they aren't drugs or nutritional supplements."

You just screwed yourself with that shill card. Playing the shill gambit is always a forfeit of the debate at hand. It is a pathetic form of cheating by trying to poison the well rather than countering with a cogent refutation that might prove your point or win a debate. I see lameoids pull this stupid blunder 10 times a day in the GMO debate. If you want to prove a fault in science, use the tools scientists use, peer reviewed studies and unbiased information sources. If you don't have solid evidence, consider what a fool you are being. Shill shill shill just makes you look like a blathering idiot and forfeits every time, the win goes to science truth. Explained simply here(or in the dictionary of your choice):
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisoning_the_well
This is especially ludicrous when you consider the GMO safety debate ended two full years ago and no company for profit anywhere would spend a single penny paying a "shill" to promote something already attained in 2016:

Everyone does. That is a variation on the old conspiracy theory that Monsanto didn't serve it in their cafeterias, despite the fact that most GMOs are only grown for cattle feed and ethanol. Then idiots applied that theory to the Obama family because Michelle grew some, just a few, of their own vegetables. None of what she grew had a GMO equivalent and she did grow GMO zucchini and yellow squash, non-GM varieties of zucchini are not safe.

Nobody would do that. There is no intent to do that. You have been duped by an anti-biotech activist site. Did you now the organic industry spends $3 billion a year to fool consumers? " The debate over whether to label foods that have been “genetically modified,” or “bioengineered,” has raged for decades, in spite of the longstanding consensus in the scientific community that mandatory labeling fails every test — scientific, economic, legal, and common-sense.
In order to preempt state-by-state initiatives that threatened to create a patchwork of labeling requirements that could prove vexing and expensive for food producers, in July 2016 Congress enacted, and President Obama signed, the National Bioengineered Food Disclosure Standard NFDS. Congress could simply have preempted the ability of states to create their own labeling requirements, but it went a bridge too far, by creating a federal mandate to label “bioengineered” food and delegating to USDA responsibility for fleshing out the regulation. It was published on December 21, 2018.
The statute made clear that labeling was not in any way linked to safety, which is why the rule came not from UDSA food safety regulators but from the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS). The statute clarified (Section 293) that bioengineered food “shall not be treated as safer than, or not as safe as, a non-bioengineered counterpart of the food,” thereby expressing agreement with the FDA that bioengineered foods are, in general, “substantially equivalent” to non-bioengineered foods in regard to health and safety attributes.
The USDA rule does not require the labeling of highly refined ingredients from bioengineered crops “if the food does not contain detectable genetically modified material,” but it allows manufacturers to make voluntary disclosures on such products. That leaves open the possibility that two identical bottles of corn oil on the supermarket shelf, derived from the same harvested field and identical in processing and quality, could be labeled differently – one as “derived from bioengineering” and the other without that designation – but both would comply with the regulation. The rule does not permit “may contain” disclosures."
NOTE - this was reproduced on the Genetic Literacy Project site from the original article in Nature Biotechnology

Next he makes up some absurd lie about GMO apples, also very ignorant because he thinks that an apple lasting 6 months is wrong when in fact all apple crops are kept in controlled storage for up to a full year. The GMO Arctic apple DOES NOT HAVE ANY EXTRA SHELF LIFE AT ALL, it is only meant to not brown inside after being cut. This is a favorite for snack pack suppliers who don't need to treat apple slices with preservatives!!

No. You posted a double fallacy, both fed to you by activists to create fear mongering memes with the intent of selling more over priced organic foods. Less than half of all GM seed has a resistance trait and there are only 3 herbicides they are resistant to. In all of those cases farmers buy them for one reason only, they allow the use of MUCH LESS PESTICIDES! No farmers would ever buy seed that requires more pesticides. Think how silly that idea is.

Would you buy seeds for your garden that will cost you a lot of money for extra pesticides? No farmers would do that either.
This explains exactly why you were given that impression and by whom. Note that 3 billion dollars are spent every year to make sure you believe lies like you just repeated: "Although GMOs are regarded as safe as their conventional counterparts by every major food safety authority in the world, the organic industry spends nearly $3 billion a year through over 330 different organizations leading with fear and “information spin” as an industry to sell their products. By creating an unfounded fear that requires tighter regulations on GMO crops, they are hoping to force them out of the food supply, thereby creating a bigger market share to sell more products in their more than $65 billion wheelhouse.
The unfortunate consequence of these [non-GMO] labels is that the food companies and lobbyists tend to create an unnecessary “us vs. them” divide. When food companies use fear against competitors to sell a product, farmers take it personally."

I just finished providing you several citations that prove beyond any doubt that GMOs mean LESS pesticide use per acre. There IS no "extra pesticide" involved you idiot. And GMOs offer only slightly larger yields, the advantage and savings is in not requiring so may pesticides and not losing as much to pests. GMOs do give higher yields than organic crops but not much more than conventional seed. Imagine growing Bt corn that protects itself from the corn borer with no spraying needed at all. Yield is the same but profit on the crop is greater with no time, fuel and cost of insecticide to pay out. This time READ the link I provided that describes exactly how GM crops lower pesticide use by 37%. No further dialog will be granted unless you do.

GMO is a laboratory breeding method for seeds. It is never under any circumstances an actual food ingredient just as hybridization, grafting and seed selection are not food ingredients Lying organic thug trolls will try to use fear mongering to convince you GMO sourced foods are not as safe when in fact they are far safer. What is not tested, ever, for safety?? Organic, heirloom, hybrid and new truck farm breeds. They go straight to store shelves with zero testing and YOU are the guinea pig. Look at what has happened because of this fact that never happened with GMO foods: "A year ago[2003] in New Zealand, there was an outbreak of food poisoning from a "killer zucchini" that hospitalized a number of people. Environmentalists jumped all over the story until it was determined that the culprit was "organic" zucchini. Plants are chemical factories that produce a multitude of toxins that protect them. An outbreak of aphid infestation had minimal impact on conventionally grown zucchini. The more vulnerable "organic" zucchini was genetically inferior because of inbreeding. They expressed dangerously high levels of the toxin curcubitan. Had this been a transgenic plant, we would be hearing about it ad nauseam, but being that it was "organic," it was quickly consigned to an Orwellian memory hole."

12 WAYS ORGANIC ACTIVISTS MISLEAD CONSUMERS
Each of these lies are carefully debunked and the dishonesty is exposed in the link for this article I provided at the bottom.
Lie #1: Conventional farmers don’t care about their soil; only organic farmers do
Lie #2: Conventional farmers douse or drench their produce in pesticides
Lie #3: Regulators are in the pocket of big industry and don’t even check if pesticides are safe
Lie #4: Organic farmers do not use pesticides or if they do, they are nice and gentle (and they only use a little)
Lie #5: Growing food naturally is always better and more sustainable
Lie #6: You can feed the world without agri-tech
Lie #7: Integrated Pest Management excludes the use of pesticides
Lie #8: The over-reliance on herbicides is leading to an explosion of super-weeds
Lie #9: Pesticide drift is a major issue
Lie #10: Our present agricultural model was built on the need to reapportion toxic chemicals after WWII
Lie #11: Large chemical companies lobby to remove regulations
Lie #12: Pesticides are a main cause of cancer

Had this been a transgenic plant, we would be hearing about it ad nauseam, but being that it was "organic," it was quickly consigned to an Orwellian memory hole."

As requested by you 143 times, here is exactly what you say does not exist -
The 'Almost' troll JUST POSTED HIS 143rd BLATANT BALD FACED LIE ABOUT HUMAN SAFETY TESTING. THIS IS REFUTATION NUMBER 143 COMPLETE WITH HYPERLINKS OF PROOF THAT PROVES THE '[USER 89]' TROLL IS LYING FOR THE 143rd TIME: Human safety feeding trials study, including quantified human risk assessment, that trolls say do not exist: Golden rice is designed to make a change in the human body with Vit. A. This is an exception to most GMO foods so Codex compliant human testing was done. Here is the study that verified the human safety and nutrition trials:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2682994/
Note that only one serving per person was required to verify the proper nutrition from golden rice. Additional servings would be a waste of time, as determined by multiple safety agencies who peer reviewed the process.
"So "why don't we do clinical trials on GMOs the same way we do for drugs?" Drugs are designed to cause a change in the human body: that's the whole point behind them. Since drugs are altering something in humans, it's important to know the side-effects that they may cause and whether or not they're causing the anticipated effect (i.e. is it better than placebo). In contrast, GMOs are designed to be equivalent to their non-GE counterparts: they aren't drugs or nutritional supplements."

GMO crop science is a laboratory breeding method for seeds. It is never under any circumstances an actual food ingredient just as hybridization, grafting and seed selection are not food ingredients Lying organic thug trolls will try to use fear mongering to convince you GMO sourced foods are not as safe when in fact they are far safer. What is not tested, ever, for safety?? Organic, heirloom, hybrid and new truck farm breeds. They go straight to store shelves with zero testing and YOU are the guinea pig. Look at what has happened because of this fact that never happened with GMO foods: "A year ago[2003] in New Zealand, there was an outbreak of food poisoning from a "killer zucchini" that hospitalized a number of people. Environmentalists jumped all over the story until it was determined that the culprit was "organic" zucchini. Plants are chemical factories that produce a multitude of toxins that protect them. An outbreak of aphid infestation had minimal impact on conventionally grown zucchini. The more vulnerable "organic" zucchini was genetically inferior because of inbreeding. They expressed dangerously high levels of the toxin curcubitan. Had this been a transgenic plant, we would be hearing about it ad nauseam, but being that it was "organic," it was quickly consigned to an Orwellian memory hole."

12 WAYS ORGANIC ACTIVISTS MISLEAD CONSUMERS
Each of these lies are carefully debunked and the dishonesty is exposed in the link for this article I provided at the bottom.
Lie #1: Conventional farmers don’t care about their soil; only organic farmers do
Lie #2: Conventional farmers douse or drench their produce in pesticides
Lie #3: Regulators are in the pocket of big industry and don’t even check if pesticides are safe
Lie #4: Organic farmers do not use pesticides or if they do, they are nice and gentle (and they only use a little)
Lie #5: Growing food naturally is always better and more sustainable
Lie #6: You can feed the world without agri-tech
Lie #7: Integrated Pest Management excludes the use of pesticides
Lie #8: The over-reliance on herbicides is leading to an explosion of super-weeds
Lie #9: Pesticide drift is a major issue
Lie #10: Our present agricultural model was built on the need to reapportion toxic chemicals after WWII
Lie #11: Large chemical companies lobby to remove regulations
Lie #12: Pesticides are a main cause of cancer

People Strongly Against GMOs Had Shakier Understanding Of Food Science, Study Finds Jan 26, 2019 "People who most intensely oppose genetically modified food think they know a lot about food science, but they actually know the least, according to a peer-reviewed paper published in January in the journal Nature Human Behaviour.
GMOs are widely considered safe by scientists, but opponents have said they want more science on the potential harm so that subjective arguments aren't part of the equation. However, previous surveys have shown that providing more scientific facts about GMOs to people doesn't change their minds.
The survey, conducted by four universities, asked 2,000 people in Europe and the United States how much they knew about genetically modified food, what their opinion was and how intense it was." Read the full coverage at:

She can cay that because it is true. Not a single case of human or farm animal harm. It is up to you to prove otherwise and I know you can not. And no, activist lies will not be valid, non-peer reviewed faked studies that are not published without paying are not valid. There are no official coroner or autopsy reports that documented death by GMO or glyphosate - even the suicides mostly fail because they survive drinking the least toxic herbicide ever formulated. There is no such thing as 'leaky gut', that is made up by a Youtube naturopath to sell his snake oil cure for a non-existent malady. The entire world, literally, says GMOs are safe and have no significant issues. The WHO, EPA, EFSA and 281 other agencies all say GMOs and glyphosate are totally safe and cause no unintended consequences. Full global consensus! All 284 global health and safety agencies agree. Yes, this is the mother of all GMO safety citations and a stake in the heart of all anti-biotech conspiratards:

DEBUNKING OF THE CLAIM OF GUT BIOME PROBLEMS FROM GLYPHOSATE
"The Samsel & Seneff study is a popular topic, and we’ve already received several questions about it. Dr. Kevin Folta, interim chair and associate professor in the Horticultural Sciences Department at the University of Florida, recently answered a similar question about the Samsel & Seneff study.
Plants are not "doused" in Roundup or, more precisely, its active ingredient glyphosate. Relatively small amounts of glyphosate are applied as weeds emerge. These die and do not compete against emerging glyphosate-resistant crops. Glyphosate is amazingly non-toxic to humans or any other animals. Acute effects are seen only at relatively high doses. The LD50 (the dose that kills half of the rats that consume the dose) is about 5,000 mg/kg of body weight. In other words, if you weigh 200 pounds, you'd have to drink about two pounds of the 41 percent commercial concentrate to have a 50 percent chance of dying. Of course, it is not recommended―ask any of the hundreds of people that have tried to commit suicide by drinking it. It takes a good dose to cause problems. Look up "glyphosate" and "suicide" in PubMed.
The flora of the gut are hardly plant-like—they are microbes, the vast majority bacteria. The "Roundup resistance" gene comes from a bacterium.
'Dr.' Stephanie Seneff. She is a computer scientist in the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at MIT. She is not a plant scientist, molecular biologist or expert in human disease. She uses the MIT affiliation and a Ph.D. to create arguments from authority without evidence. Her evidence is largely correlation. She claims that glyphosate causes autism. And obesity. And Parkinson's. And depression. And ADHD. And several other ailments.
She explains their effect being caused by "exogenous semiotic entropy," a phrase that, if Googled, gives you her paper in Entropy, a low-/no-impact physics journal that has a reputation of publishing anything for a fee. It claims peer review, but no biologist or medical researcher reviewed the work. The phrase "exogenous semiotic entropy" sounds fancy, but she's the first person to use it.
Glyphosate is a great tool for farmers; it keeps labor and fuels costs lower, and it allows for "no-till" farming, saving valuable topsoil."

"Leaky gut syndrome is a hypothetical, medically unrecognized condition.[1]
Unlike the scientific phenomenon of increased intestinal permeability ("leaky gut"),[1][2] claims for the existence of "leaky gut syndrome" as a distinct medical condition come mostly from nutritionists and practitioners of alternative medicine.[1][3][4] Proponents claim that a "leaky gut" causes chronic inflammation throughout the body that results in a wide range of conditions, including chronic fatigue syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, migraines, multiple sclerosis, and autism.[1][3] As of 2016, there is little evidence to support the hypothesis that leaky gut syndrome directly causes this wide array of diseases.[1][5] Stephen Barrett has described "leaky gut syndrome" as a fad diagnosis and says that its proponents use the alleged condition as an opportunity to sell a number of alternative-health remedies – including diets, herbal preparations, and dietary supplements.[4]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_gut_syndrome
"A proposed gastrointestinal disorder dubbed ‘leaky gut syndrome’ is currently the topic of numerous debates throughout the medical and natural health communities. Some alternative medicine practitioners claim that leaky gut syndrome is a prevalent problem responsible for ill health in many people. However, most physicians maintain that there is not enough research to prove that it is a legitimate issue. This is all speculation, as scientific studies do not validate any of these claims. It is extremely dangerous that a TV doctor personality and some otherwise trusted practitioners are diagnosing and treating this baseless ‘syndrome’."

"Three years ago Mark Crislip wrote about leaky gut syndrome for SBM. He said, “because of an almost complete lack of supporting basic science and few therapeutic clinical trials showing no effect, virtually no physician who has an understanding of the gastrointestinal physiology gives the disease credence.” Nothing has changed.
Intestinal permeability is a real thing, but according to this review article “these terms are poorly defined, their assessment is a matter of debate, and their clinical significance is not clearly established.” Leaky gut syndrome, on the other hand, is a fad diagnosis not accepted by mainstream medicine. The Canadian Gastrointestinal Society calls it a myth"

This is called willful ignorance. You are confronted with 100% complete rebuttals that prove beyond any sane doubt that you were wrong and instead of recognizing your ignorance you dig in your heels and cover your ears and mutter lalalalalalala. I can't help you with that but you are the reason why the organic fear mongering budget has grown to $3 billion dollar annually - IT WORKS!!! "Although GMOs are regarded as safe as their conventional counterparts by every major food safety authority in the world, the organic industry spends nearly $3 billion a year through over 330 different organizations leading with fear and “information spin” as an industry to sell their products. By creating an unfounded fear that requires tighter regulations on GMO crops, they are hoping to force them out of the food supply, thereby creating a bigger market share to sell more products in their more than $65 billion wheelhouse.
The unfortunate consequence of these [non-GMO] labels is that the food companies and lobbyists tend to create an unnecessary “us vs. them” divide. When food companies use fear against competitors to sell a product, farmers take it personally."

THIS IS REFUTATION NUMBER 138 COMPLETE WITH HYPERLINKS OF PROOF THAT PROVES THE '[USER 89]' TROLL IS LYING FOR THE 138th TIME: Human safety feeding trials study, including quantified human risk assessment, that trolls say do not exist: Golden rice is designed to make a change in the human body with Vit. A. This is an exception to most GMO foods so Codex compliant human testing was done. Here is the study that verified the human safety and nutrition trials:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2682994/
Note that only one serving per person was required to verify the proper nutrition from golden rice. Additional servings would be a waste of time, as determined by multiple safety agencies who peer reviewed the process.
"So "why don't we do clinical trials on GMOs the same way we do for drugs?" Drugs are designed to cause a change in the human body: that's the whole point behind them. Since drugs are altering something in humans, it's important to know the side-effects that they may cause and whether or not they're causing the anticipated effect (i.e. is it better than placebo). In contrast, GMOs are designed to be equivalent to their non-GE counterparts: they aren't drugs or nutritional supplements."

People Strongly Against GMOs Had Shakier Understanding Of Food Science, Study Finds
Jan 26, 2019 "People who most intensely oppose genetically modified food think they know a lot about food science, but they actually know the least, according to a peer-reviewed paper published in January in the journal Nature Human Behaviour.
GMOs are widely considered safe by scientists, but opponents have said they want more science on the potential harm so that subjective arguments aren't part of the equation. However, previous surveys have shown that providing more scientific facts about GMOs to people doesn't change their minds.
The survey, conducted by four universities, asked 2,000 people in Europe and the United States how much they knew about genetically modified food, what their opinion was and how intense it was." Read the full coverage at:

GMO crops fully comply to all Codex rules in every way. The Almost troll has posted this malicious lie about compliance more than 100 times in the last year, I have called out and disproved his lie 100 times. ALL READERS - ask this idiot why he insists on posting lies you can verify are lies by checking the actual USDA Codex pages. The US and the EU both adhere fully to the Codex rules our USDA wrote. All safety recommendation that are applicable are followed to the letter which is why it takes an average of 13 years to get a new GMO approved. Almost is caught in another lie, one which he has tried to foist over 90 times in the last year. Every single time I catch this mentally ill idiot and call him out. Read the Codex information linked below to understand what a incredibly ignorant asshole liar Almost is. The USDA wrote the original Codex for the world and they adhere to it in all actions. Almost is a mentally ill obsessed liar. Here is the full CURRENT AND LATEST statement by the USDA about how they wrote and follow the Codex:
https://www.usda.gov/codex
This home page links many aspects of documentation and compliance which clearly make this Almost troll a fucking liar for all to see.
"The U.S. Codex Office (USCO), housed in USDA’s Trade and Foreign Agricultural Affairs, acts as the national focal point for the U.S. Codex Program. Its mission is to engage stakeholders in the development and advancement of science-based food standards for the benefit of the United States and the worldwide community. USCO manages the planning, policy development, support, and coordination for U.S. involvement in Codex, and develops strategies to accomplish U.S. objectives."

I see you in a very hard sell for your channel. You even spammed other channels like this one. You did not confront the liar in your comments who ranted falsely about how her "organic food tasted better". This the enemy. You made a HUGE rant in a comment there, nobody on Youtube has the attention span to read such long posts. These are my unfiltered thoughts. I wish you luck but at this time there are several hundred more channels from farmers like you. None of them reach the high views needed to reach enough people. One approach I have seen is featuring many other channels on yours, collecting and liking them on your home page. Maybe organize them a bit more? How about "100 Farmers speak out"? I don't know what would work, Youtubers are so stupid. Find some gimmick that attracts the short attention span crowd here but please no click bait titles, way too much of that already.

Youtube discontinued direct messaging a couple years ago. I have never posted a video but I do see how some things work. When an original comment is posted in a thread that person can delete it and all replies to it with a single command. Flagging and reporting trolls or channels does not work unless 3 reports of the exact same type are done within a 3 month period. You can private message me at Facebook.

Your post is a bit confusing as to your precise point. The topic was covered reasonably in a short video. Youtube videos are not college courses for credit. The best non-collegiate source for basic education on GMOs from an unbiased source is the non-profit
GeneticLieracyProject.org
Do a Youtube search for the following: 'gmos' to find hundreds of videos that do in fact want us to "worry and stress over what we eat" while making matters much worse by lying and repeating malicious myths about GMO science that were made up by the organic foods cartel. They fund all the anti-biotech sites and videos. 32 years and counting:

Note that in that search you will find this video near the top, with the highest number of views. Star talk has more videos from NDG Tyson about GMOs, take them all in as a whole if you want to judge his motives.

Systematic debunking of the myth that GMOs have caused an increase in ALLERGIES
: "There is no short list of culprits. Microbiome, Western diet, and socioeconomic status to name a few. A number of groups have also blamed genetically modified food. According to the Organic Consumers Association, the main trade group for the organic food industry. However, of the foods that most frequently cause food allergy, GM versions simply don’t exist.
There is no GM peanut (although development of a hypoallergenic GM peanut is ongoing). There is no GM milk. Or consumable GM egg (although there is now that makes medicine). However, a few cases of allergenicity cropped up during early experiments involving genetically engineered foods, which piqued concerns. [this mandatory testing prevented them from being approved]
European Union health agencies, and member nation health agencies, as well as the US FDA, EPA and USDA, are all involved in necessary rigorous assessments of GM foods (or any other foods) for allergic potential. The EPA, in fact, maintains an extensive list of foods that could trigger allergies. Another resource used to test for allergens is the University of Nebraska’s Allergen Online, which matches amino acid sequences of possible allergens with reference proteins known to cause allergies. And, so far, no single biotechnology-based protein in food has been found to cause an allergic reaction.The causes behind the increase in food allergies are not known. While anti-GMO groups have pointed to biotechnology, there are other proposed causes, each with a varying degree of data to support each.
Allergic reactions are complex. Even though eight foods cause most allergies, many more can cause specific reactions, because everybody’s intestinal, nervous and immune systems are different (not to mention their genetics). While certain genetically engineered experimental foods were found to have allergens, these allergens were known and caught by researchers in early stages, just as a test on organic peanuts would also show a potential allergic reaction in sensitive people. And further studies have shown that transgenics technology does not make a food any more allergenic — but neither does it automatically make it less (unless the target trait is allergenicity)."

GMO technology is not about ending world hunger and never was. GMO technology is about farmers like me using much much less pesticides and much much safer pesticides with the pesticides even safer than many of the pesticides that Organic growers use. The CBS Evening News had a piece 8-30-2017 on how gmo technology was being use to cure some cancers. They showed exactly how is being done and they are also working on other cancers trying to cure them. Man has been breeding plants in all different ways for thousands of years to help benefit mankind. 500 years ago a carrot was pure white. GMO technology is use in many things to better the world. Almost all Insulin used today by diabetics is GMO insulin. GMO rennet has been used for decades to make cheese. The cheese making enzyme breaks down proteins and separates them from whey. Golden Rice to benefit vitamin A-deficient children. & BT CORN AND COTTON. GMO proteins include blood- clotting factors to help Hemophiliacs, the hepatitis B vaccine, thyroid hormones, laundry detergent enzymes, and many synthetically produced amino acids used in nutritional supplements. There are many many many more benefits of GMO technologies. We all should give thanks to GOD for giving us the wisdom of GMO and stand up to those that tell lies about GOD's blessings trying to play GOD themselves trying to take away his blessings.

The benefits are farmers like me can use much less and much safer pesticides. Being able to use less and safer pesticides is a benefit to everyone. GMO technology seed cost a lot more money but being able to use less and safer pesticides more than makes up for the extra cost.

Out of all the many many many many herbicides I could choose to use on my gmo technology crops can you name one that is safer than glyphosate?

Thank for proving that I was correct and that you are clueless about this subject and could not answer the simple question. Don't you think it is a benefit to the consumer when we use the safest pesticides possible. The consumer does. Organic growers use much more toxic pesticides than we do. The IARC which a division of the World Health Organization which is what you are talking about said in March of 2015 that Glyphosate was probably a carcinogenic. They also said that beer, coffee, cell phones, aloe vera, pickled vegetables, fried chicken, and sunlight were also probably carcinogenic. They agreed that Glyphosate is the safest herbicides that farmers have ever used. In fact the LD 50 number which is the ratings used all the world to measure toxicity with the HIGHER the number the LOWER the toxicity. To show how low a toxicity Glyphosate has here are some examples. Nicotine 9 caffeine 192 Tylenol 338 Codeine 427 2-4-D 665 OFF for mosquitoes 1014 Table salt 3000 Vinegar 3300 Baking Soda 4220 Roundup(Glyphosate) 5600.
Out of many many many herbicides that farmers can use on gmo crops GLYPHOSATE is by far the SAFEST of them ALL. Can you name one herbicide that is safer than GLYPHOSATE? Glyphosate is even safer than many of the pesticides that Organic growers use.
https://risk-monger.blogactiv.eu/2016/03/18/10-reasons-why-glyphosate-is-good/
Glyphosate is applied at specific rate and no more just like all the other herbicides that Farmers use.

All pesticides have signal words are found on pesticide product labels, and they describe the acute (short-term) toxicity of the formulated pesticide product. The signal word can be either: DANGER, WARNING or CAUTION. Products with the DANGER signal word are the most toxic. Products with the WARNING signal word are next in toxicity. Products with CAUTION signal word are have no toxicity. The signal word on Glyphosate is CAUTION. The IARC which a division of the World Health Organization which is what you are talking about said in March of 2015 that Glyphosate was probably a carcinogenic. They also said that beer, coffee, cell phones, aloe vera, pickled vegetables, fried chicken, and sunlight were also probably carcinogenic.

Yes readers, google golden rice to see this asshole liar troll is posting lies again as usual. The context of his INTENTIONALLY MISQUOTED citation is for use in the US where the FDA does not endorse GR2E as a vitamin A source for ONE REASON ONLY - US children eat 24 times less rice on average than typical Asian children. When anti-biotech liars misrepresented this data for activism the FDA got good and pissed off and issued a reply:

Almost' JUST POSTED HIS 137th BLATANT BALD FACED LIE ABOUT HUMAN SAFETY TESTING. THIS IS REFUTATION NUMBER 137 COMPLETE WITH HYPERLINKS OF PROOF THAT PROVES THE '[USER 89]' TROLL IS LYING FOR THE 137th TIME: Human safety feeding trials study, including quantified human risk assessment, that trolls say do not exist: Golden rice is designed to make a change in the human body with Vit. A. This is an exception to most GMO foods so Codex compliant human testing was done. Here is the study that verified the human safety and nutrition trials:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2682994/
Note that only one serving per person was required to verify the proper nutrition from golden rice. Additional servings would be a waste of time, as determined by multiple safety agencies who peer reviewed the process.
"So "why don't we do clinical trials on GMOs the same way we do for drugs?" Drugs are designed to cause a change in the human body: that's the whole point behind them. Since drugs are altering something in humans, it's important to know the side-effects that they may cause and whether or not they're causing the anticipated effect (i.e. is it better than placebo). In contrast, GMOs are designed to be equivalent to their non-GE counterparts: they aren't drugs or nutritional supplements."

40,000 food products with Non-GMO Project label may be “false or misleading,” FDA guidance document says
"The Non-GMO label may see its ubiquitous butterfly wings trimmed, according to a new guidance document from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) aimed at promoting accurate food marketing practices. In late March 2019, the agency released a set of recommended guidelines detailing how non-GMO and GMO-derived products should be labeled in order to comply with federal law.
The update only “represents the current thinking” of the FDA on the issue and compliance with the new guidance is voluntary. But the agency identified specific kinds of information commonly found on non-GMO labels as “false or misleading,” suggesting the FDA wants food companies to rethink their marketing strategies. The clarification also may open the door to legal challenges of companies using non-GMO labels that can be seen as deceiving to consumers.
Varieties of everything from beer to breakfast cereal are marketed as non-GMO in grocery stores across the US. That includes thousands of foods that do not have a GMO version on the market, including salt, raisins and tomatoes. For the most part, those who embrace non-GMO labeling, many of them committed organic food advocates, share the same fundamental animosity toward so-called genetically engineered foods. Some, like the organic industry group Just Label It, also argue that the labels promote “transparency in our food system.” Many farmers and scientists argue just the opposite, saying that such labels promote confusion and the misleading belief that non-GMO products are safer or more nutritious than their genetically engineered counterparts.
Last fall, the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation, an organization that has been rated by the University of Pennsylvania as the top science and technology think tank in the US, submitted a citizen’s petition to the FDA challenging the use of the Non-GMO Project’s logo, saying that it “deliberately deceives and misleads consumers in violation of the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.”
“They are exactly the sort of deceptive and misleading labels Congress was intent on prohibiting,” Val Giddings, a geneticist and senior fellow at the ITIF, told the GLP by email. ITIF petitioned the FDA “….to issue a regulation prohibiting the use of the term ‘Non-GMO’ on consumer foods and goods and requiring distributors to omit any ‘Non-GMO’ term or claims on their labeling.” Many products brandish various non-GMO labels, including eggs, green beans and walnuts (among many more examples), which don’t have genetically engineered equivalents on the market. Some of them, like the FDA’s example of salt, don’t contain any DNA whatsoever. Advertising a product that contains no DNA as “non-GMO” is misleading. Henry Miller, the founding director of the FDA’s Office of Biotechnology, has argued that these labels prompt “nearly half of consumers [to] avoid GMO-labeled foods.” He called on the FDA to go further and stop food companies from marketing products as non-GMO when there are no GMO equivalents available to the public."

Yea instead you speak down to and deeply insult our honest hard working farmers and crop scientists, accusing them of all sorts of crimes and diseases that never happened.
Systematic debunking of the myth that GMOs have caused an increase in ALLERGIES
: "There is no short list of culprits. Microbiome, Western diet, and socioeconomic status to name a few. A number of groups have also blamed genetically modified food. According to the Organic Consumers Association, the main trade group for the organic food industry. However, of the foods that most frequently cause food allergy, GM versions simply don’t exist.
There is no GM peanut (although development of a hypoallergenic GM peanut is ongoing). There is no GM milk. Or consumable GM egg (although there is now that makes medicine). However, a few cases of allergenicity cropped up during early experiments involving genetically engineered foods, which piqued concerns. [this mandatory testing prevented them from being approved]
European Union health agencies, and member nation health agencies, as well as the US FDA, EPA and USDA, are all involved in necessary rigorous assessments of GM foods (or any other foods) for allergic potential. The EPA, in fact, maintains an extensive list of foods that could trigger allergies. Another resource used to test for allergens is the University of Nebraska’s Allergen Online, which matches amino acid sequences of possible allergens with reference proteins known to cause allergies. And, so far, no single biotechnology-based protein in food has been found to cause an allergic reaction.The causes behind the increase in food allergies are not known. While anti-GMO groups have pointed to biotechnology, there are other proposed causes, each with a varying degree of data to support each.
Allergic reactions are complex. Even though eight foods cause most allergies, many more can cause specific reactions, because everybody’s intestinal, nervous and immune systems are different (not to mention their genetics). While certain genetically engineered experimental foods were found to have allergens, these allergens were known and caught by researchers in early stages, just as a test on organic peanuts would also show a potential allergic reaction in sensitive people. And further studies have shown that transgenics technology does not make a food any more allergenic — but neither does it automatically make it less (unless the target trait is allergenicity)."

Bt is harmless. Bt gmo technology is now being use in Europe as in all over the world. Organic growers have used Bt for decades even injecting some food with Bt. I am sure you have heard of Bt corn. Bt corn contains naturally occurring Bacillus thuringiensis bacteria, a result of recombinant DNA techniques. that selectively kill caterpillar pest. Organic growers have for decades approved sprays containing Bt, a naturally occurring soil bacterium. Bt produces biotoxins lethal to moths,caterpillars and butterflies when ingested. Because it targets these insects' intestinal membranes(ABSENT in HUMANS and ANIMALS ), the EPA considers it benign to non- caterpillar species, including beneficial insects. When Organic growers spray Bt they kill all moths,caterpillars, and butterflies but we do not do that with gmo corn because only corn bore and corn root worms attacks corn so they are the only insects affected. For 80 years farmers like me used dangerous dangerous pesticides to control theses insects but today we do not have to use them thanks to gmo technology. GMO technology is safer for my children, my Wife, our water, our farm, and our environment. WE and YOU should give thanks to almighty GOD for the wisdom of GMO Technology.

Russia is funding online articles that question the safety of genetically modified crops and biotechnology in an effort to hurt U.S. agricultural interests and sow public divisions, according to Iowa State University researchers
The researchers said that if Moscow was able to turn U.S. public opinion against genetically modified organisms (GMOs), it could hurt the U.S. agricultural industry, which relies heavily on genetically engineered crops, the Des Moines Register reports.
The researchers found more articles mentioning GMOs in the U.S. versions of the Russian-backed news sites RT and Sputnik than five other American news organizations — Breitbart News, Huffington Post, Fox News, CNN and MSNBC — combined.
Among the seven news sites, the two Russian news sites produced more than 50 percent of all GMO-related articles and usually portrayed GMOs negatively. RT published “nearly all” of the articles where the term GMO appeared as “click bait,” the researchers said.
The researchers said the anti-GMO effort was part of Russia's push to grow its own agricultural sector, which is the country's second-largest industry behind oil and gas, the researchers noted. Russia banned growing genetically engineered crops in 2016.
They also said the anti-GMO articles appeared to be trying to create divisions in the U.S. similar to efforts during the 2016 election."

28 minutes ago
"[USER 302] Would you consider uploading videos? You seem to have a firm foundation to build on. I'm serious. You have over 50 subscribers, just on your comments."
My answer to Wednesday A - "Thanks but not really interested, I'm far too busy finding and debunking nasty liars every day here. Only half of the days I can find time to search for the new posted videos about GMOs that attack them ignorantly. There are others like me but I do more links that prove I am repeating proven facts, not just trolling based on personal opinions and nonsense the organic farming organizations spread constantly. This hobby is more than a full time job already and it pays only in satisfaction. I highly recommend you visit ground zero for GMO education, the non-profit
GeneticLiteracyProject.org
where I post every day and there is no propaganda from industry or organic trolls. Youtube is a hot mess."

"More than one-third of Americans do not know that foods with no genetically modified ingredients contain genes, according to a nationally representative Food Literacy and Engagement Poll we conducted in 2017 at Michigan State University
For the record, all foods contain genes, and so do all people. The majority of respondents who answered this question incorrectly were young and affluent, and also more likely than their peers to describe themselves as having a higher-than-average understanding of the global food system. The full survey revealed that much of the U.S. public remains disengaged or misinformed about food. These findings are problematic because food shapes our lives on a personal level, while consumer choices and agricultural practices set the course for our collective future in a number of ways, from food production impacts to public health. Rapid scientific innovation has made it possible to engineer crops that can grow without fertilizer, survive flooding and supply vital nutrients to communities in the developing world. But further progress may be limited without public awareness and support for research on urgent food and agriculture challenges.
Meanwhile, the proliferation of online content with conflicting messages makes it hard for Americans to separate valid nutritional information from fads and fraud. Influential multinational corporations push ideas that aren’t always based in science, but rather intended to promote their own products.
Our inaugural poll reveals that the public lags far behind current scientific understanding when it comes to food. Equally troubling, Americans aren’t turning to scientists for answers. consumers wade through conflicting recommendations from friends, relatives and celebrities that compete with fake news online for attention. Meanwhile, advertisements and talking heads argue over the health benefits of staples like chocolate and coffee."

Myth of a cancer connection with glyphosate - Debunking of gullible activists and Youtube flunkies referring to two and ONLY TWO sources that claimed there was a cancer risk, BOTH have been discredited for fraud and bribery, leaving NO SCIENTIFIC SOURCE for that malicious claim. Fraud number one - Seralini rat torture:
https://allianceforscience.cornell.edu/blog/2018/06/european-studies-disprove-seralinis-gmo-maize-tumor-claims/
Fraud number two - Organic farmers sent a $160,000 cash bribe to the IARC through a corrupt USRTK lawyer to get them to make the low cancer risk statement about glyphosate. It was the cornerstone of all these shyster lawyer Roundup lawsuits but now that Congress has cut off its $2mill annual finding to the IARC they are in deep doodoo. Citations:

The often reproduced image of rats with large tumors came from the fake scientist fraud Seralini. How dishonest can you get? The Seralini quack has been completely debunked and ejected from the scientific community for his lies about GMOs and rats. For starters, he used a species of lab rat known to always grow many tumors by age one no matter what it is fed! The EU launched a massive campaign 6 years ago to either verify or disprove all of Seralini's claims from his organic farmer funded fake lab in France. Results? Not a single claim could be verified or reproduced, all study methods were found to be extremely faulty and misleading. Seralini will go down in history as the top anti-GMO fraud of this century!

Pre-GMO safety testing standards, before our FDA, USDA & EPA started demanding 75+ tests on each new GMO before approval, the following happened: In the late 1960s, researchers from the US Department of Agriculture, Penn State University and the Wise Potato Chip Company collaborated to breed the “Lenape” potato. This new breed soon became hugely popular with potato chip manufacturers, due to the fact that it had the perfect combination of sugar and starch to produce the thin, crispy golden brown potato chips that we know today.
But the Lenape potato’s biggest legacy might be its impact on the GMO debate. After the new breed was introduced, the USDA found that it contained heightened levels of solanine, an alkaloid that helps protect the potato against pests that is also slightly toxic and harmful to humans.
The Lenape potato shows that risk and uncertainty is not just associated with genetically modified crops, but crops that come from conventional breeding as well. According to a new article on Boing Boing, “there’s actually a lot more risk and uncertainty with conventional breeding, than there is with genetic modification. That’s because, with GM, you’re mucking about with a single gene. There are a lot more genes in play with conventional breeding, and a lot more ways that surprising genetic interactions could come back to haunt you.”

"Leaky gut syndrome is a hypothetical, medically unrecognized condition.[1]
Unlike the scientific phenomenon of increased intestinal permeability ("leaky gut"),[1][2] claims for the existence of "leaky gut syndrome" as a distinct medical condition come mostly from nutritionists and practitioners of alternative medicine.[1][3][4] Proponents claim that a "leaky gut" causes chronic inflammation throughout the body that results in a wide range of conditions, including chronic fatigue syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, migraines, multiple sclerosis, and autism.[1][3] As of 2016, there is little evidence to support the hypothesis that leaky gut syndrome directly causes this wide array of diseases.[1][5] Stephen Barrett has described "leaky gut syndrome" as a fad diagnosis and says that its proponents use the alleged condition as an opportunity to sell a number of alternative-health remedies – including diets, herbal preparations, and dietary supplements.[4]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_gut_syndrome
"A proposed gastrointestinal disorder dubbed ‘leaky gut syndrome’ is currently the topic of numerous debates throughout the medical and natural health communities. Some alternative medicine practitioners claim that leaky gut syndrome is a prevalent problem responsible for ill health in many people. However, most physicians maintain that there is not enough research to prove that it is a legitimate issue. This is all speculation, as scientific studies do not validate any of these claims. It is extremely dangerous that a TV doctor personality and some otherwise trusted practitioners are diagnosing and treating this baseless ‘syndrome’."

Myth of a cancer connection with glyphosate - Debunking of gullible activists and Youtube flunkies referring to two and ONLY TWO sources that claimed there was a cancer risk, BOTH have been discredited for fraud and bribery, leaving NO SCIENTIFIC SOURCE for that malicious claim. Fraud number one - Seralini rat torture:
https://allianceforscience.cornell.edu/blog/2018/06/european-studies-disprove-seralinis-gmo-maize-tumor-claims/
Fraud number two - Organic farmers sent a $160,000 cash bribe to the IARC through a corrupt USRTK lawyer to get them to make the low cancer risk statement about glyphosate. It was the cornerstone of all these shyster lawyer Roundup lawsuits but now that Congress has cut off its $2mill annual finding to the IARC they are in deep doodoo. Citations:

A common meme we all hear if we are exposed to lying activist sites and videos is that the Monsanto boogeyman and "corporations" want to "control the world's seed supply". Let's ponder that for a moment which is all it takes to realize how absurd and ignorant that meme really is. All the corporate seed companies combined comprise less than 20% of our global seed supply. A partial list of the plethora of supply sources they can never touch: free NGO and government run seed programs, seed banks and vaults, seed exchanges, seed libraries, neighbors swapping seed, farm granges, online seed sales, small local farm supply stores, gardening supply stores, collecting seed from wild sources, countries like Mexico where GMO seed is rejected, China with its own GMO and conventional seed programs, Asshole Russia with their anti-GMO troll armies, seed saving practices, remote villages who never have and never will buy seed, and mountain terrace farmers at the ends of 200 kilometer long foot paths in mountainous regions of three continents. Are corporate seed sellers going to march jack booted thugs up those paths with packs full of seed they will force the remote villages to buy?? Myth busted!

Scathing exposure of the treachery of the organic foods cartel's attack on the superior performance of GMO crops and foods:
In New York, organic farming groups and organic activist organizations sued Monsanto for alleged malicious lawsuits against innocent farmers regarding faultless drift of patented seeds. Obviously one of the first steps was for the judge to ask for examples of such malicious lawsuits for the court to examine. NO EXAMPLES COULD BE PRODUCED FOR THE COURT!! The case was thrown out. Actual court transcript to totally back up my post here:
http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/12-1298.Opinion.6-6-2013.1.PDF
Monsanto only sued for obvious blatant criminal abuse of their patented seeds. Bayer will do the same. All cases get due process and convincing evidence of criminal intent must be proved for prosecution.

Up-to-date latest news about the cancer case fraud - complete with citation link. " Home-field advantage in Missouri trial could boost Bayer’s fortunes in glyphosate-cancer legal battle Bayer …. facing an upcoming trial in St. Louis over allegations that its Roundup weed killer causes cancer, has recruited Missouri-based expert witnesses to make its case in a place where it has century-old roots but where juries often hit companies with huge damages.
Four expert witnesses Bayer is seeking to admit hail from Missouri universities, and some legal experts said the company is trying to clinch its first favorable Roundup verdict by emphasizing its reputation as a major local employer. The trial in St. Louis County Circuit Court, expected to begin on Aug. 19, was brought by Illinois resident Sharlean Gordon, who says she was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma after using Roundup for around 14 years at her home. It is the fourth trial over Roundup and the first one outside of California, where three juries hit Bayer with verdicts as large as $2 billion. Bayer is appealing those verdicts."

[USER 730] posted a blathering screed that claimed the following: "There are no GMOs for blight. There aren't any for GMOs extreme temperatures. Flooding crops are not GMO, but use marker technology. Salty soils? Global warming? These are the pesticide industry claims that GMOs are necessary to feed the world and save our food from climate change." Well guess what you science hating conspiratard? It took 5 minutes to find proof you are wrong on every count. 3 kinds of blight resistant potatoes:
https://www.growingproduce.com/vegetables/3-gmo-late-blight-resistant-potato-varieties-get-epa-approval/
All other denials covered on one page: Biotech Crops Adapted to Climate Change
Crops can be modified faster through biotechnology than conventional crops, thus hastening implementation of strategies to meet rapid and severe climatic changes. Pest and disease resistant biotech crops have continuously developed as new pests and diseases emerge with changes in climate. Resistant varieties will also reduce pesticide application and hence CO2 emission. Crops tolerant to various abiotech stresses have been developed in response to climatic changes.
Salinity Tolerant Crops
Biotech salt tolerant crops have been developed and some are in the final field trials before commercialization. In Australia, field trials of 1,161 lines of genetically modified (GM) wheat and 1,179 lines of GM barley modified to contain one of 35 genes obtained from wheat, barley, maize, thale cress, moss or yeasts are in progress since 2010 and will run till 2015. Some of the genes are expected to enhance tolerance to a range of abiotic stresses including drought, cold, salt and low phosphorous. Sugarcane that contains transcription factor (OsDREB1A) is also under field trial from 2009 to 2015.4
More than a dozen of other genes influencing salt tolerance have been found in various plants. Some of these candidate genes may prove feasible in developing salt tolerance in sugarcane 4, rice5,6, barley 7, wheat 8, tomato9, and soybean10.
Drought Resistant Crops
Transgenic plants carrying genes for water-stress management have been developed. Structural genes (key enzymes for osmolyte biosynthesis, such as proline, glycine/betaine, mannitol and trehalose, redox proteins and detoxifying enzymes, stress-induced LEA proteins) and regulatory genes, including dehydration–responsive, element-binding (DREB) factors, zinc finger proteins, and NAC transcription factor genes, are being used. Transgenic crops carrying different drought tolerant genes are being developed in rice, wheat, maize, sugarcane, tobacco, Arabidopsis, groundnut, tomato, potato and papaya.11, 12
An important initiative for Africa is the Water Efficient Maize for Africa (WEMA) project of the Kenyan-based African Agricultural Technology Foundation (AATF) and funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) and Howard G. Buffet Foundations. Drought tolerant WEMA varieties developed through marker assisted breeding could be available to farmers within the next two or three years. Drought-tolerant and insect-protected varieties developed using both advanced breeding and transgenic approaches could be available to farmers in the later part of the decade.13 In 2012, a genetically modified drought tolerant maize MON 87460 that expresses cold shock protein B has been approved in the US for release in the market.14
Biotech Crops for Cold Tolerance
By using genetic and molecular approaches, a number of relevant genes have been identified and new information continually emerges. Among which are the genes controlling the CBF cold-responsive pathway and together with DREB1 genes, integrate several components of the cold acclimation response to tolerance low temperatures.15
Cold tolerant GM crops are being developed such as GM eucalypti, which is currently being field tested in the US by Arborgen LLC since 2010. Thale cress has been improved to contain the DaIRIP4 from Deschapsia antarctica, a hairgrass that thrives in frosts down to -30C, and sugarcane are being introgressed with genes from cold tolerant wild varieties.4
Biotech Crops for Heat Stress
Expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs) has been associated with recovery of plants under heat stress and sometimes, even during drought. HSPs bind and stabilize proteins that have become denatured during stress conditions, and provide protection to prevent protein aggregation. In GM chrysanthemum containing the DREBIA gene from Arabidopsis thaliana, the transgene and other heat responsive genes such as the HSP70 (heat shock proteins) were highly expressed when exposed to heat treatment. The transgenic plants maintained higher photosynthetic capacity and elevated levels of photosynthesis-related enzymes.16"

'Almost' JUST POSTED HIS 129th BLATANT BALD FACED LIE ABOUT HUMAN SAFETY TESTING. THIS IS REFUTATION NUMBER 129 COMPLETE WITH HYPERLINKS OF PROOF THAT PROVES THE '[USER 89]' TROLL IS LYING FOR THE 129th TIME: Human safety feeding trials study, including quantified human risk assessment, that trolls say do not exist: Golden rice is designed to make a change in the human body with Vit. A. This is an exception to most GMO foods so Codex compliant human testing was done. Here is the study that verified the human safety and nutrition trials:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2682994/
Note that only one serving per person was required to verify the proper nutrition from golden rice. Additional servings would be a waste of time, as determined by multiple safety agencies who peer reviewed the process.
"So "why don't we do clinical trials on GMOs the same way we do for drugs?" Drugs are designed to cause a change in the human body: that's the whole point behind them. Since drugs are altering something in humans, it's important to know the side-effects that they may cause and whether or not they're causing the anticipated effect (i.e. is it better than placebo). In contrast, GMOs are designed to be equivalent to their non-GE counterparts: they aren't drugs or nutritional supplements."

Jurors are emotional. The IARC which a division of the World Health Organization which is what you are talking about said in March of 2015 that Glyphosate was probably a carcinogenic. They also said that beer, coffee, cell phones, aloe vera, pickled vegetables, fried chicken, and sunlight were also probably carcinogenic. They agreed that Glyphosate is the safest herbicides that farmers have ever used. In fact the LD 50 number which is the ratings used all the world to measure toxicity with the HIGHER the number the LOWER the toxicity. To show how low a toxicity Glyphosate has here are some examples. Nicotine 9 caffeine 192 Tylenol 338 Codeine 427 2-4-D 665 OFF for mosquitoes 1014 Table salt 3000 Vinegar 3300 Baking Soda 4220 Roundup(Glyphosate) 5600.
Out of many many many herbicides that farmers can use on gmo crops GLYPHOSATE is by far the SAFEST of them ALL. Can you name one herbicide that is safer than GLYPHOSATE? Glyphosate is even safer than many of the pesticides that Organic growers use.
https://risk-monger.blogactiv.eu/2016/03/18/10-reasons-why-glyphosate-is-good/
Glyphosate is applied at specific rate and no more just like all the other herbicides that Farmers use.

The signal word – Danger, Warning or Caution – is found on the labels of pesticides and indicates the acute level of toxicity if the product is swallowed, spilled on skin, splashed in eyes, or inhaled. Danger Poison with a Skull and Crossbones appears on the most toxic pesticides. Warning on the next level of lower toxicity and for the very safe ones the signal word is caution which is on Glyphosate(Roundup). To get more precise look at the label and find the LD50 number. Yes all the companies today that produce and sell Glyphosate know the pure safety of the product. Yes THEY KNOW.

"A gene that increases a rice plant's resistance to floods also boosts its ability to recover from droughts, a study has shown.
Researchers found that the gene, Sub1A, allowed to plants to survive by growing fresh shoots after a period of drought.
Rice is the primary food for three billion people, and more than 25% the world's harvest is grown in areas that experience extreme weather conditions.
Details have been published in the journal The Plant Cell.
"Flood tolerance does not reduce drought tolerance in these plants, and appears to even benefit them when they encounter drought," observed lead author Julia Bailey-Serres from the University of California Riverside's department of botany and plant sciences."

I've heard this tune before. Time to change the beat. [Fifth Element] The disgruntled originator of this variety has been left in the dust by years of high acceptance of the improved potatoes and even more advanced varieties. The FDA not only approved them after review, it requests more be done to further reduce the known carcinogen acrylamide in further development of GMO potatoes. "The FDA and USDA have extensively reviewed Innate potatoes and found them to be "as safe and nutritious as their conventional counterparts." Additionally, recent FDA guidance to food producers on acrylamide recommends adoption of new potato varieties as a method of helping the public reduce dietary intake of acrylamide." http://www.innatepotatoes.com//get-answers It think this guy may be just yanking my chain, this is TOO EASY! A 9 year old computer literate kid could easily search out the overwhelming preponderance of evidence of testing, approval and full safety of GMO potatoes. This loser [USER 730] is functionally blinded by activist propaganda.

Again you put your naturalistic fallacy above the reality of crop science today. Evolution and conventional breeding is far too slow for our urgent needs and nothing you lie about will change this fact. We absolutely will all starve to death if we do not fast track the adaptation of seed to meet unnaturally fast climate changes we have caused. Even the 10+ years for new GMOs is far too long, hence the current shift to Crispr technology. It is so fast and accurate it will be fast tracked and not labeled as GMO.

Readers -again this troll links a biased article, not a study, that was issued during the early phase of Crispr technology. Ask yourself why safety agencies are leaning towards not controlling Crispr like GMO seed. This is because it is far more accurate and does not involve gene splicing from different species.
[USER 730] is lying about golden rice which is totally past development after they ACHIEVED EXACT[USER 730 NAME]Y WHAT THEY WANTED. The most extensive testing ever done to any GMO in all history is over and documented for all to see if you are not willfully ignorant. It has been tested after storage and DOES NOT exhibit a serious loss of beta carotene. This new paper that was peer reviewed and published March 11 of 2019 will tell you everything you want to know about GR2E with no activist lies mixed in:
https://www.intechopen.com/books/vitamin-a/golden-rice-to-combat-vitamin-a-deficiency-for-public-health
It includes 68 hyperlinked references and 11 foot notes, a wealth of non-activist information I would not have come across if not for this idiot attacking the best GMO ever conceived. "To date the Golden Rice project has principally engaged plant scientists. Activist opposition to Golden Rice has been led principally by non-scientists [and assholes like [USER 730]], who have been very successful in developing a narrative about Golden Rice and gmo crops which serves the activist’s purpose1 but is fundamentally inaccurate [8]. Further background to the development of Golden Rice, including the political dimensions, is detailed elsewhere [6, 9, 10]. Eighty percent—about 380 million tonnes—of global rice production is produced on small farms for family consumption, usually unprocessed except for polishing [38]. It is probably not stored for long, as rice is produced, usually, in two or three growth cycles annually, and storage facilities are limited. Data have shown that degradation of the β-carotene is minimal 2 months after harvest and samples of Golden Rice stored in ambient temperatures for 4.5 years remain noticeably yellow, indicating continued presence of β-carotene [39]."
This study on the storage of golden rice found the highest stability came with vacuum storage away from light but it covers other storage methods and says it is light and heat that increase loss of the vitamin. Note GR2E was oly released this hear so any storage studies were done on experimental samples, There is no actual field produced GR2E to test for aging loss at this time. It is possible the very worst case scenario for storage could mean losses approaching 80% but there has been no real world testing for this from actual crops. The [USER 730] troll offers no source for his claim, gee, I wonder why....

Again I easily prove [USER 730] is lying, this time about drought resistant corn - "Since the 1960s, national average corn yields have been increasing by just under 2 bushels per year as a result of many factors, including the development of corn varieties that are hardier and more resilient to biological stresses (such as plant diseases and pests) and environmental stresses (such as freezes and droughts). The DT corn varieties currently available have benefited from this type of basic research. However, most DT varieties are the direct result of applied private-sector research and breeding that selects plants based on their yields in growing conditions with limited water. In 2012, the first year after the limited release of DT seeds to farmers, only about 2 percent of total U.S. corn acreage was planted with DT varieties. Five years later, in 2016, just over 22 percent of total U.S. corn acreage was planted with DT varieties.Most of the DT corn varieties currently sold in the United States have drought tolerance developed through conventional breeding rather than genetic engineering. Yet, 91 percent of DT corn fields in 2016 were planted to corn that is also herbicide tolerant and insect resistant. Combining DT with one or more of these GE traits could be a result of many factors, but some evidence suggests these pest management traits are complementary. For example, a corn crop will generally be less vulnerable to drought if it is not competing with weeds for water, and if its roots and leaves are not damaged by insect pests. Use of DT corn varieties, especially when combined with other soil moisture conservation practices, can play a significant role in farmers’ risk management strategies. Under mild-to-moderate drought conditions, there will be differences in yield losses between DT and non-DT corn fields. Increasing variability in yield losses could lead to changes in the number of farms receiving certain Federal crop insurance indemnity and/or disaster assistance payments, as well as payment amounts."

It's not my goal, it is the goal off farmers much more experienced than you or me. The fact you can not lie about, discredit or force into secrecy is that corn yields continue to rise as modern crop science advances. This will continue and not reverse under any circumstance outside of organic farms with their expected lower yields and more water use.

Monsanto shut down two years ago and this liar troll Buck knows it but posts his activist screeds anyways. Expired patent GMO seeds are increasing in numbers every year. Seed researchers are using that high performance seed to further enhance performance as it becomes open sourced and the companies with expired patents have no say in this. The golden age of high performance expired patent seed has just begun. Every GMO patent today will expire after 20 years, becoming a gift to humanity.

"Amid the GMO debate, one researcher is striving to use genetic modification to not just improve crop health, but potentially save consumer lives. Aspergillus, which creates carcinogenic aflatoxin, can now be controlled through genetic modification.
Aflatoxins are found in corn, peanuts, cottonseed, milk, walnuts, pistachios and Brazil nuts.
“This [new GM corn] will make a difference in the U.S., but will make the biggest difference in the undeveloped world,” says Monica Schmidt, University of Arizona researcher. “There they don’t test corn [for aflatoxins] and about 4.5 billion people consume the toxin.”
People in undeveloped countries are 16 to 32 times more likely to develop cancer, namely liver cancer, she adds. In addition, aflatoxins can stunt children’s growth and damage immune systems. The new GM corn shuts the toxin down and doesn’t allow it to accumulate in the corn kernel.
Using RNAi technology, Schmidt and her team silence the aflatoxin genes in aspergillus fungi in only the corn’s kernels. The ear could still show the greenish, powdery fungal spores on the surface, however, aflatoxin should not enter the kernels."

The [USER 730] troll is really pushing that absurd lie about the percentage of GMO seeds that 'express pesticides'. None exist, not a single one. The extremely safe PROTEIN used by both organic farmers and the GMO Bt crops is one of 20 million PROTEINS, they can only find a chemical receptor to bind to in the guts of borer worm pests and nothing else. Bt exists naturally in soil bacteria. Less than half of all GM seed offers that trait. This verifies every word in my post here is backed by science:

There are two entirely different ways to discuss the 'percentage' of GMOs grown on Earth - one is by the raw tonnage of seed and total acres planted, the other is by counting the total number of GMO seed varieties and then listing the 25% of them that use the Bt trait or the 20% of them that are glyphosate resistant. The former, by tons of seed planted for staple crops, means about 48% of all GMOs are Bt traited,
NOT 98% OR ANYTHING NEAR THAT!!
The latter is about the hundreds of different applications needed by farmers globally. Half of those have no Bt or pesticide resistance traits.
Most of the latter are created to help farmers with extremes like flooding, drought, extreme temperatures, salty soils, increase blight and other challenges exacerbated by global warming factors. This GMO corn trait is only to prevent highly toxic aflatoxin fungus in corn crops:

"Roundup Ready" means ready for 700 different glyphosate formulations. Wikipedia uses 11 citations to show how glyphosate is marketed globally under more then 750 brand names: "Glyphosate is marketed in the United States and worldwide by many agrochemical companies, in different solution strengths and with various adjuvants, under dozens of tradenames.[74][75][76][77] As of 2010, more than 750 glyphosate products were on the market.[78] In 2012, in terms of volume about half of the total global consumption of glyphosate was for agricultural crops;[79] the forestry sector is another important market.[80] Asia and the Pacific was the largest and fastest growing regional market.[79] Chinese manufacturers collectively are the world's largest producers of glyphosate and its precursors[81] and account for about 30% of global exports.[79] Key manufacturers include Anhui Huaxing Chemical Industry Company, BASF, Bayer CropScience, Dow AgroSciences, DuPont, Jiangsu Good Harvest-Weien Agrochemical Company, Monsanto, Nantong Jiangshan Agrochemical & Chemicals Co., Nufarm Limited, SinoHarvest, Syngenta, and Zhejiang Xinan Chemical Industrial Group Company.[79]"

"French and German farmers jointly called on European governments to renew the license for glyphosate weedkiller, saying there was no evidence it was toxic and banning it would severely harm farming. “We need to be able to continue to use some crop protection products, not because of some kind of stupid addiction like some say, but because the alternative means are not there,” French oilseed growers group FOP Arnaud Rousseau said on Thursday. “We strongly hope that with the new government there will be a new approval of glyphosate,” said Wolfgang Vogel, head of German oilseeds industry association UFOP. “It would be very hard for farmers if they had to renounce glyphosate.”

Thank goodness FDA and EPA testing of foods no longer finds dangerous levels of Atrazine, paraquat, DDT, fludioxonil, metolaclor, acephate and diazinon. Now they find minute traces of the least toxic herbicide ever formulated, glyphosate, which is 43% less toxic than table salt, and Bt, so non-toxic that organic farmers rely on it heavily. WHAT A DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENT!!!! Anti-GMO idiots claim they want to go back to that nightmare list of much more toxic pesticides. Why???? I can't imagine.

30,000 food products with Non-GMO Project label may be “false or misleading,” FDA guidance document says
"The Non-GMO label may see its ubiquitous butterfly wings trimmed, according to a new guidance document from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) aimed at promoting accurate food marketing practices. In late March 2019, the agency released a set of recommended guidelines detailing how non-GMO and GMO-derived products should be labeled in order to comply with federal law.
The update only “represents the current thinking” of the FDA on the issue and compliance with the new guidance is voluntary. But the agency identified specific kinds of information commonly found on non-GMO labels as “false or misleading,” suggesting the FDA wants food companies to rethink their marketing strategies. The clarification also may open the door to legal challenges of companies using non-GMO labels that can be seen as deceiving to consumers.
Varieties of everything from beer to breakfast cereal are marketed as non-GMO in grocery stores across the US. That includes thousands of foods that do not have a GMO version on the market, including salt, raisins and tomatoes. For the most part, those who embrace non-GMO labeling, many of them committed organic food advocates, share the same fundamental animosity toward so-called genetically engineered foods. Some, like the organic industry group Just Label It, also argue that the labels promote “transparency in our food system.” Many farmers and scientists argue just the opposite, saying that such labels promote confusion and the misleading belief that non-GMO products are safer or more nutritious than their genetically engineered counterparts.
Last fall, the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation, an organization that has been rated by the University of Pennsylvania as the top science and technology think tank in the US, submitted a citizen’s petition to the FDA challenging the use of the Non-GMO Project’s logo, saying that it “deliberately deceives and misleads consumers in violation of the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.”
“They are exactly the sort of deceptive and misleading labels Congress was intent on prohibiting,” Val Giddings, a geneticist and senior fellow at the ITIF, told the GLP by email. ITIF petitioned the FDA “….to issue a regulation prohibiting the use of the term ‘Non-GMO’ on consumer foods and goods and requiring distributors to omit any ‘Non-GMO’ term or claims on their labeling.” Many products brandish various non-GMO labels, including eggs, green beans and walnuts (among many more examples), which don’t have genetically engineered equivalents on the market. Some of them, like the FDA’s example of salt, don’t contain any DNA whatsoever. Advertising a product that contains no DNA as “non-GMO” is misleading. Henry Miller, the founding director of the FDA’s Office of Biotechnology, has argued that these labels prompt “nearly half of consumers [to] avoid GMO-labeled foods.” He called on the FDA to go further and stop food companies from marketing products as non-GMO when there are no GMO equivalents available to the public."

Up-to-date latest news about the cancer case fraud - complete with citation link. " Home-field advantage in Missouri trial could boost Bayer’s fortunes in glyphosate-cancer legal battle Bayer …. facing an upcoming trial in St. Louis over allegations that its Roundup weed killer causes cancer, has recruited Missouri-based expert witnesses to make its case in a place where it has century-old roots but where juries often hit companies with huge damages.
Four expert witnesses Bayer is seeking to admit hail from Missouri universities, and some legal experts said the company is trying to clinch its first favorable Roundup verdict by emphasizing its reputation as a major local employer. The trial in St. Louis County Circuit Court, expected to begin on Aug. 19, was brought by Illinois resident Sharlean Gordon, who says she was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma after using Roundup for around 14 years at her home. It is the fourth trial over Roundup and the first one outside of California, where three juries hit Bayer with verdicts as large as $2 billion. Bayer is appealing those verdicts."

If you spend much time looking at the fear mongering lies you will figure out this is a 32 year long disinformation campaign by the organic foods cartel that has got a boost by the Russian anti-GMO troll army that copies their tactics. Both groups have the same goal, sell more produce or grains by dishonest fear mongering. There are ups and downs though, Obama kicked ass when he banned all those organic lobbyist fear mongering food labeling campaigns. The revelation of that $160,000 cash bribe by organic farmers to the IARC was not discovered soon enough, shyster lawyers have duped thousands into lining up for Roundup lawsuit payoffs that will never happen. The buy-off for that low cancer risk classification from the IARC is now out in the open and that organization is in deep doo doo. Liar trolls care little, they just make up more myths and lies but we won't see the IARC cited in any future cases. Citations:

"The U.S. Department of Agriculture approved a new kind of cotton — one that's been genetically engineered so that the seeds are safe to eat.
The invention promises to open new markets for cottonseed, and it could give cotton farming a big boost. Because cotton plants are prodigious seed producers: Every pound of cotton fiber, or lint, comes with 1.6 pounds of seed.
"You're getting more cottonseed than you are lint," says Greg Holt, who leads research on cotton production and processing at a USDA research station in Lubbock, Texas.
Each seed is the size of a small peanut. In principle, it could be highly nutritious. It contains lots of oil and protein.
The problem is that the seeds, like the cotton plant's leaves, contain little dark glands full of something called gossypol.
"Gossypol in and of itself is a toxin," explains Holt. It's helpful for the cotton plant, because it helps fend off insect pests. But it makes the seed unhealthy for people to eat. It's toxic to most animals, too.
So there are limited options for the 40 million tons of cottonseed that stream out of cotton gins around the world each year.
"Seed can go in one of two directions," Holt says. "You're either going to the dairy industry, or you're going to the oil mill."
But Keerti Rathore wanted to expand those options. So 23 years ago, when he arrived at Texas A&M University, he set out to make a cotton plant with seeds that people can eat. "This was my first project, and hopefully it's coming to an end, and a good conclusion," he says. Rathore inserted a new piece of DNA into the cotton plant. In the plant's seeds, it turned off a key gene, the one responsible for producing gossypol. The gene stayed active in the rest of the plant.
And it worked. There's still gossypol in leaves of this genetically engineered plant, to protect against insects. But the seeds are almost completely gossypol-free. They're safe to eat. Cut them open, and they even look different. They don't have those little dark glands. Researchers at Texas A&M tested the plants in greenhouses and small field plots. They also roasted a few and ate them. Rathore says they taste like chickpeas. This week, the U.S. Department of Agriculture gave this new cotton a green light. Anybody in the U.S. can grow them. Before the seeds can be sold as food or feed, they'll need approval from the Food and Drug Administration. If that happens, all kind of doors will open. Cottonseed could be used to feed chickens, or fish. The meal could go into protein bars.
Rathore's real goal, though, is to see it growing in places like India, where he grew up; places where a lot of people aren't eating well. "A lot of these countries that do suffer from malnutrition are also cotton producers," he says. "So I think that those countries may benefit much more from this technology." China and India are the world's two top cotton-growing countries.

I don't understand. The edible cotton seed is an example of sufficient engineering, not insufficient. In the last 50 years, global hunger and malnutrition has been cut in half. It continues to drop as a percentage of population. GMO crop engineering is providing solutions, more all the time. Bangladesh is really doing great with its GMO eggplant:

ALL PATENTS EXPIRE after 20 years. GMO soybeans are generic and cheap now, a bargain for farmers. FARMERS DO NOT WANT TO REPLANT HYBRID SEEDS!!! Farmers quit saving Hybrid seed in mid 1930's and as each crop became a hybrid farmers quit saving seed from that crop. We have had patented seed ever since Congress passed the Plant Variety Protection Act in 1970 Protecting Plant Breeders with patent rights. It is illegal to save patented seed and does not mater if it is GMO or non GMO seed. Farmers are law abiding citizens but some think they are above the law. If you save seed do not buy patented seed to do so. A first grade child can understand that. There are many companies even foreign companies producing and selling GMO technology seed. That favorite whipping boy Monsanto was bought out and when it did exist it only controlled 20% of the GM seed market globally. Expired patent seed is a gift to humanity.

It is a pathetic form of cheating by trying to poison the well rather than countering with a cogent refutation that might prove your point or win a debate. I see lameoids pull this stupid blunder 10 times a day in the GMO debate. If you want to prove a fault in science, use the tools scientists use, peer reviewed studies and unbiased information sources. If you don't have solid evidence, consider what a fool you are being. Shill shill shill just makes you look like a blathering idiot and forfeits every time, the win goes to science truth. Explained simply here(or in the dictionary of your choice):
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisoning_the_well
This is especially ludicrous when you consider the GMO safety debate ended two full years ago and no company for profit anywhere would spend a single penny paying a "shill" to promote something already attained.

“If you love it so much, why don’t you marry it?”
Who doesn’t remember this ridiculous line from their childhood? The schoolyard taunt was directed at a whole array of things that one might be inclined to defend – best friends, the teacher, or your favorite color crayon. Normally, or hopefully, most people grow out of such childish taunts when they reach an adult age and start to mature.
.... Most people, but not anti-GMO morons. Apparently that isn’t necessarily true for anti-GMO activists and, unfortunately, one interviewer used such a taunt against a respected scientist while he was attempting to promote Golden Rice. The now infamous YouTube video shows a short clip of an interview with Dr. Patrick Moore, where he states that glyphosate does not cause cancer and that you could drink a quart of it without it hurting you. The interviewer then mocks Dr. Moore by offering him a glass of glyphosate to drink. Realizing the interview is a sham, Dr. Moore ends the interview and walks off camera. The video clip launched the attack by anti-GMO activists of Dr. Moore and anyone supporting genetic modification – if glyphosate is so safe, then why don’t you drink it? Naturally, activists also alleged that Dr. Moore was a paid Monsanto lobbyist.

Myth about Agent Orange being Monsanto's creation: "Agent Orange is the name given to the combination of two commercially available herbicides[2,4-D & 2,4,5-T] which had been used for decades before the Vietnam War. The former Monsanto, which was primarily a chemical company, along with 9 other companies, supplied the U.S. government these herbicides as part of the war effort. The combination of these herbicides is what the U.S. government named Agent Orange after the colour of the stripe put on the barrels that contained it.
The nine Agent Orange manufacturers were government contractors acting at the direction of the government, which was exercising its authority under the U.S. War Powers Act. The government set the manufacturing specifications for Agent Orange, and decided when, where and how it was used. Agent Orange was only made for military use by the government.
In 2009, the U.S. Supreme Court let stand lower court rulings that the manufacturers were not responsible for the implications of military use of Agent Orange because the war materials were supplied at the direction of the U.S. government."

When a hateful malicious toxic liar is called out by me that is a kindness and a public service to patch the huge hole in what passes for Youtube moderation. You are reaping exactly what you sow. I do not enjoy this, it is disgusting that humans profess so much public hate behind the backs of our farmers. Hate speech has been causing mass shootings and hate speech can cause farmers to lose their jobs or have their fields vandalized, You are doing that, asshole. If you don't like being called out on your offense, stop visiting this page.

Monsanto was bought two and half years ago and does not exist. Your post make you like morron buck. Terminator seeds do not not exist. Roundup Ready Wheat was never brought out of research and never available to be grown by farmers and was discontinued in 2002. Anti gmoers broke into the research department and spread some of the seed. Wheat is not a gmo technology crop. Farmers freely choose to grow gmo technology canola all around the world and do so in a big way.

Your post is False again Buck and full of
lies.You
can NOT spray more and more glyphosate for the the labeled rate has always been the same. Another big fat lie. We have replaced the harmful herbicide of the past with the safety of glyphosate and we are using much much less herbicide today than ever before. Glyphosate NEVER controlled all weeds. There are NO superweeds! You can NOT name a superweed buck and you know it. That is a lie told by people like you buck. Herbicide resistance has been a problem with ALL herbicides. 2,4-D and banvel are herbicides used by city people to control dandelions on lawns , city parks and golf courses. Glyphosate is used three months before harvest and even before the crop blooms unlike the toxic pesticides Organic growers use. Why all the lies buck?

You are an ignorant liar repeating conspiracy theories spread by organic farmer groups. Monsanto shut down two years ago.
All GMO seeds, with NO exception, are tested for years before approval. Our FDA, USDA & EPA demand over 75 tests. There is no proof of any corruption in our safety agencies. Testing comes from many different sources - private, collegiate, government and international groups.

"Leaky gut syndrome is a hypothetical, medically unrecognized condition.[1]
Unlike the scientific phenomenon of increased intestinal permeability ("leaky gut"),[1][2] claims for the existence of "leaky gut syndrome" as a distinct medical condition come mostly from nutritionists and practitioners of alternative medicine.[1][3][4] Proponents claim that a "leaky gut" causes chronic inflammation throughout the body that results in a wide range of conditions, including chronic fatigue syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, migraines, multiple sclerosis, and autism.[1][3] As of 2016, there is little evidence to support the hypothesis that leaky gut syndrome directly causes this wide array of diseases.[1][5] Stephen Barrett has described "leaky gut syndrome" as a fad diagnosis and says that its proponents use the alleged condition as an opportunity to sell a number of alternative-health remedies – including diets, herbal preparations, and dietary supplements.[4]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_gut_syndrome
"A proposed gastrointestinal disorder dubbed ‘leaky gut syndrome’ is currently the topic of numerous debates throughout the medical and natural health communities. Some alternative medicine practitioners claim that leaky gut syndrome is a prevalent problem responsible for ill health in many people. However, most physicians maintain that there is not enough research to prove that it is a legitimate issue. This is all speculation, as scientific studies do not validate any of these claims. It is extremely dangerous that a TV doctor personality and some otherwise trusted practitioners are diagnosing and treating this baseless ‘syndrome’."

"Three years ago Mark Crislip wrote about leaky gut syndrome for SBM. He said, “because of an almost complete lack of supporting basic science and few therapeutic clinical trials showing no effect, virtually no physician who has an understanding of the gastrointestinal physiology gives the disease credence.” Nothing has changed.
Intestinal permeability is a real thing, but according to this review article “these terms are poorly defined, their assessment is a matter of debate, and their clinical significance is not clearly established.” Leaky gut syndrome, on the other hand, is a fad diagnosis not accepted by mainstream medicine. The Canadian Gastrointestinal Society calls it a myth"

You have told many LIES buck.. Glyphosate can NOT be used on your everyday garden products. There are many many many many herbicides that you could choose on your gmo technology crops. Glyphosate is NOT use to ripen foods. The IARC which a division of the World Health Organization which is what you are talking about said in March of 2015 that Glyphosate was probably a carcinogenic. They also said that beer, coffee, cell phones, aloe vera, pickled vegetables, fried chicken, and sunlight were also probably carcinogenic. They agreed that Glyphosate is the safest herbicides that farmers have ever used. In fact the LD 50 number which is the ratings used all the world to measure toxicity with the HIGHER the number the LOWER the toxicity. To show how low a toxicity Glyphosate has here are some examples. Nicotine 9 caffeine 192 Tylenol 338 Codeine 427 2-4-D 665 OFF for mosquitoes 1014 Table salt 3000 Vinegar 3300 Baking Soda 4220 Roundup(Glyphosate) 5600.
Out of many many many herbicides that farmers can use on gmo crops GLYPHOSATE is by far the SAFEST of them ALL. Can you name one herbicide that is safer than GLYPHOSATE? Glyphosate is even safer than many of the pesticides that Organic growers use.
https://risk-monger.blogactiv.eu/2016/03/18/10-reasons-why-glyphosate-is-good/
Glyphosate is applied at specific rate and no more just like all the other herbicides that Farmers use.

You have told many LIES Almost. Glyphosate can NOT be used on your everyday garden products. There are many many many many herbicides that you could choose on your gmo technology crops. Glyphosate is NOT use to ripen foods. Glyphosate has been proven not to cause cancer unlike the toxic pesticides Organic growers use and that is one reason farmers all over the world love glyphosate because of it's pure safety. Out of all the many many many many herbicides we could choose to use on our gmo technology crops can you name one that is safer than Glyphosate? Not answering this question confirms you agree that glyphosate is the safest of them all.

buck is a proven lying Russian Troll who will not answer any simple questions and has NO proof of the lies he tells and misinformation he spreads. Glyphosate never controlled all weeds buck. As more and more farmers started using glyphosate the safest of all herbicides even much safer than the toxic pesticides Organic growers use the rate per acre of glyphosate has remained the same as 44 years ago. Glyphosate been proven NOT to cause cancer all over the world unlike the toxic pesticides Organic growers use. The amount of herbicide farmers use today on each acre is much less now than before glyphosate. I know as a farmer we use much less and much safer pesticides. Do you know anything about Bt buck?

Your post is false. Monsanto was bought out two and half years ago and does not exist. Farmers are free to purchase the seed they choose. Many of the pesticides organic growers use are highly toxic much more toxic than any thing that could be used on gmo technology crops. They should be regulated.

your activist propaganda with no proof is pathetic. That dicamba issue was resolved with a new low-vapor variety but it did not "kill" 3 million acres, it wilted them and reduced the yields in most cases. Dicamba is not an exclusively GMO pesticide in any case. Organic pesticides can be very toxic and carcinogenic. Unlike you I prove my assertions because I am not lying.
http://ascienceenthusiast.com/organic-crops-use-carcinogenic-pesticides/
You can NOT prove a single human or animal ever died from GMOs or glyphosate in all history. You can provide no links that documented autopsy and coroner reports ruling death by GMOs unless it was intentional suicide, and most of those fail because glyphosate is so mild.

Playing the shill gambit is always a forfeit of the debate at hand. It is a pathetic form of cheating by trying to poison the well rather than countering with a cogent refutation that might prove your point or win a debate. I see lameoids pull this stupid blunder 10 times a day in the GMO debate. If you want to prove a fault in science, use the tools scientists use, peer reviewed studies and unbiased information sources. If you don't have solid evidence, consider what a fool you are being. Shill shill shill just makes you look like a blathering idiot and forfeits every time, the win goes to science truth. Explained simply here(or in the dictionary of your choice):
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisoning_the_well
This is especially ludicrous when you consider the GMO safety debate ended two full years ago and no company for profit anywhere would spend a single penny paying a "shill" to promote something already attained.

Four expert witnesses Bayer is seeking to admit hail from Missouri universities, and some legal experts said the company is trying to clinch its first favorable Roundup verdict by emphasizing its reputation as a major local employer. The trial in St. Louis County Circuit Court, expected to begin on Aug. 19, was brought by Illinois resident Sharlean Gordon, who says she was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma after using Roundup for around 14 years at her home. It is the fourth trial over Roundup and the first one outside of California, where three juries hit Bayer with verdicts as large as $2 billion. Bayer is appealing those verdicts."

No you are just digging a deeper hole for us to bury you in with facts that slay conspiracy theories. The organic lobby and the organic foods cartel has a greater annual revenue than all biotech seed companies combined. Do you need a citation f proof for that? I can provide it. There is no "Monsanto/Bayer", there is only Bayer AG and a file drawer full of old Monsanto patents. You are a mindless minion of the largest hoax ever perpetrated on this planet - the organic promise of 'chemical free'.

Look at what has happened because of this fact that never happened with GMO foods: "A year ago[2003] in New Zealand, there was an outbreak of food poisoning from a "killer zucchini" that hospitalized a number of people. Environmentalists jumped all over the story until it was determined that the culprit was "organic" zucchini. Plants are chemical factories that produce a multitude of toxins that protect them. An outbreak of aphid infestation had minimal impact on conventionally grown zucchini. The more vulnerable "organic" zucchini was genetically inferior because of inbreeding. They expressed dangerously high levels of the toxin curcubitan. Had this been a transgenic plant, we would be hearing about it ad nauseam, but being that it was "organic," it was quickly consigned to an Orwellian memory hole."

The USDA wrote the original Codex Alimentarius for the world and they adhere to it in all actions. 'Almost' is a mentally ill obsessed liar attacking this thread repeatedly while claiming we don't adhere to the policies we wrote for the world which includes GMO safety guidelines. Here is the full statement by the USDA about how they wrote and follow the Codex:
https://www.usda.gov/codex
This home page links many aspects of documentation and compliance which clearly make this Almost troll a fucking liar for all to see.
"The U.S. Codex Office (USCO), housed in USDA’s Trade and Foreign Agricultural Affairs, acts as the national focal point for the U.S. Codex Program. Its mission is to engage stakeholders in the development and advancement of science-based food standards for the benefit of the United States and the worldwide community. USCO manages the planning, policy development, support, and coordination for U.S. involvement in Codex, and develops strategies to accomplish U.S. objectives."

No need for organic foods to be labelled to tell you when they are breed with radiation induced mutagenesis, 2400 organic crops owe their origin to Mutagenesis. Why do you only want gmo technology crops and any products that sources any ingredient derived from a gmo technology crops to be labeled? We all have a right to know don't we?

Playing the shill gambit is always a forfeit of the debate at hand. It is a pathetic form of cheating by trying to poison the well rather than countering with a cogent refutation that might prove your point or win a debate. I see lameoids pull this stupid blunder 10 times a day in the GMO debate. If you want to prove a fault in science, use the tools scientists use, peer reviewed studies and unbiased information sources. If you don't have solid evidence, consider what a fool you are being. Shill shill shill just makes you look like a blathering idiot and forfeits every time, the win goes to science truth. Explained simply here(or in the dictionary of your choice):
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisoning_the_well
This is especially ludicrous when you consider the GMO safety debate ended two full years ago and no company for profit anywhere would spend a single penny paying a "shill" to promote something already attained.

This home page links many aspects of documentation and compliance which clearly make this Almost troll a fucking liar for all to see.
"The U.S. Codex Office (USCO), housed in USDA’s Trade and Foreign Agricultural Affairs, acts as the national focal point for the U.S. Codex Program. Its mission is to engage stakeholders in the development and advancement of science-based food standards for the benefit of the United States and the worldwide community. USCO manages the planning, policy development, support, and coordination for U.S. involvement in Codex, and develops strategies to accomplish U.S. objectives."

The USDA wrote the original Codex Alimentarius for the world and they adhere to it in all actions. 'Almost' is a mentally ill obsessed liar attacking this thread repeatedly while claiming we don't adhere to the policies we wrote for the world which includes GMO safety guidelines.

'Almost' JUST POSTED HIS 118TH BLATANT BALD FACED LIE ABOUT HUMAN SAFETY TESTING. THIS IS REFUTATION NUMBER 118 COMPLETE WITH HYPERLINKS OF PROOF THAT PROVES THE '[USER 89]' TROLL IS LYING FOR THE 118th TIME: Here is the study that verified the human safety trials:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2682994/
Note that only one serving per person was required to verify the proper nutrition from golden rice. Additional servings would be a waste of time, as determined by multiple safety agencies who peer reviewed the process. This was the human safety feeding trials study, including quantified human risk assessment, that trolls say do not exist.
"So "why don't we do clinical trials on GMOs the same way we do for drugs?" Drugs are designed to cause a change in the human body: that's the whole point behind them. Since drugs are altering something in humans, it's important to know the side-effects that they may cause and whether or not they're causing the anticipated effect (i.e. is it better than placebo). In contrast, GMOs are designed to be equivalent to their non-GE counterparts: they aren't drugs or nutritional supplements."
https://geneticliteracyproject.org/2016/01/13/no-long-term-gmo-studies-humans/
Golden rice is an exception since it is designed to make a change in the human body with Vit. A, Codex compliant human testing was done.

This Almost moron claims GMO foods are 'risky' when in fact they are far safer than other foods. Here's why - What is not tested, ever, for safety?? Organic, heirloom, hybrid and new truck farm breeds. They go straight to store shelves with zero testing and YOU are the guinea pig. Look at what has happened because of this fact that never happened with GMO foods: "A year ago[2003] in New Zealand, there was an outbreak of food poisoning from a "killer zucchini" that hospitalized a number of people. Environmentalists jumped all over the story until it was determined that the culprit was "organic" zucchini. Plants are chemical factories that produce a multitude of toxins that protect them. An outbreak of aphid infestation had minimal impact on conventionally grown zucchini. The more vulnerable "organic" zucchini was genetically inferior because of inbreeding. They expressed dangerously high levels of the toxin curcubitan. Had this been a transgenic plant, we would be hearing about it ad nauseam, but being that it was "organic," it was quickly consigned to an Orwellian memory hole."

Golden rice passed the only required human safety feeding study, the first human trials ever performed on any GMO food. Only one day of measuring metabolizing of the vitamin A was required to prove it works. It is now past approval and the first fields are now planted in Bangladesh and Philippines. No liar can prove this is false. No liar can prove more safety testing is needed under any laws in existence. 20 years of testing brought us to this victory for curing blindness. Watch the news early next year as poor communities express joy when they see the end to blindness and stunted growth thanks to this miracle of crop science.
Here is the study that verified the human safety trials:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2682994/
Note that only one serving per person was required to verify the proper nutrition from golden rice. Additional servings would be a waste of time, as determined by multiple safety agencies who peer reviewed the process.

Not one penny paid out in lawsuits and the next one is in the farming state of Missouri where a different tune will be sung. "A California judge will slash a $2 billion judgment against Bayer AG, which had been awarded to a couple who both developed cancer after decades of using Roundup to kill weeds.Smith said the $2 billion exceeded legal precedent and that she was considering an award closer to $250 million. If the parties can’t agree on a new amount …. the case would go to a retrial."

People Strongly Against GMOs Had Shakier Understanding Of Food Science, Study Finds Jan 26, 2019 "People who most intensely oppose genetically modified food think they know a lot about food science, but they actually know the least, according to a peer-reviewed paper published in January in the journal Nature Human Behaviour.
GMOs are widely considered safe by scientists, but opponents have said they want more science on the potential harm so that subjective arguments aren't part of the equation. However, previous surveys have shown that providing more scientific facts about GMOs to people doesn't change their minds.
The survey, conducted by four universities, asked 2,000 people in Europe and the United States how much they knew about genetically modified food, what their opinion was and how intense it was." Read the full coverage at:

What is not tested, ever, for safety?? Organic, heirloom, hybrid and new truck farm breeds. They go straight to store shelves with zero testing and YOU are the guinea pig. Look at what has happened because of this fact that never happened with GMO foods: "A year ago[2003] in New Zealand, there was an outbreak of food poisoning from a "killer zucchini" that hospitalized a number of people. Environmentalists jumped all over the story until it was determined that the culprit was "organic" zucchini. Plants are chemical factories that produce a multitude of toxins that protect them. An outbreak of aphid infestation had minimal impact on conventionally grown zucchini. The more vulnerable "organic" zucchini was genetically inferior because of inbreeding. They expressed dangerously high levels of the toxin curcubitan. Had this been a transgenic plant, we would be hearing about it ad nauseam, but being that it was "organic," it was quickly consigned to an Orwellian memory hole."

If so, there is no proof of that. The US still feeds the world. Dead soil can't grow huge bumper crop yields. Glyphosate breaks down in soil by microbial action. Thank goodness FDA and EPA testing of foods no longer finds dangerous levels of Atrazine, paraquat, DDT, fludioxonil, metolaclor, acephate and diazinon. Now they find minute traces of the least toxic herbicide ever formulated, glyphosate, which is 43% less toxic than table salt, and Bt, so non-toxic that organic farmers rely on it heavily. WHAT A DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENT!!!! Anti-GMO idiots claim they want to go back to that nightmare list of much more toxic pesticides. Why???? I can't imagine.

THIS MENTAL CASE 'Almost' JUST POSTED HIS 105TH BLATANT BALD FACED LIE ABOUT HUMAN SAFETY TESTING. THIS IS REFUTATION NUMBER 105 COMPLETE WITH HYPERLINKS OF PROOF THAT PROVES THE '[USER 89]' TROLL WRONG FOR THE 105th TIME: Human safety feeding trials study, including quantified human risk assessment, that trolls say do not exist: "So "why don't we do clinical trials on GMOs the same way we do for drugs?" Drugs are designed to cause a change in the human body: that's the whole point behind them. Since drugs are altering something in humans, it's important to know the side-effects that they may cause and whether or not they're causing the anticipated effect (i.e. is it better than placebo). In contrast, GMOs are designed to be equivalent to their non-GE counterparts: they aren't drugs or nutritional supplements."
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2682994/
Golden rice is an exception since it is designed to make a change in the human body with Vit. A, Codex compliant human testing was done. Here is the study that verified the human safety trials:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2682994/
Note that only one serving per person was required to verify the proper nutrition from golden rice. Additional servings would be a waste of time, as determined by multiple safety agencies who peer reviewed the process.

Insanity is defined as doing the same thing over and over while expecting a different result each time. This mentally ill 'Almost' troll has posted the same lie 104 times and no doubt he will continue even after I proved him a liar by posting a link to proof the safety trials he claimed had not been done were already completed.

The astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson will return to television after the broadcasters of his shows announced Friday that they had completed their investigation into sexual misconduct allegations against him.
“The investigation is complete, and we are moving forward with both ‘StarTalk’ and ‘Cosmos,’” Fox Broadcasting and National Geographic said of his two shows. “‘StarTalk’ will return to the air with the remaining 13 episodes in April on National Geographic, and both Fox and National Geographic are committed to finding an air date for ‘Cosmos.’ There will be no further comment.”
https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/15/arts/neil-degrasse-tyson-sexual-misconduct.html
This investigation in no way detracts from his huge list of lifetime achievements. He is far from retirement. pusang keeps coming back to get his ass kicked over and over! This is as easy as shooting fish in a barrel.

Note how pusang's channel page is blank. Forget the fake name, this account fully exhibits the traits of a Russian troll army attack.
TV “news channel” RT (formerly Russia Today, which has its roots in Pravda), the Kremlin’s English-language propaganda arm, is the mouthpiece for Russia President Vladimir Putin’s agenda.
A report from the Office of the U.S. Director of National Intelligence (DNI) implicated RT in Russian hacking during the 2016 presidential election. It found that the network uses the internet and social media to conduct “strategic messaging for the Russian government” and that its programming aims “at undermining viewers’ trust of U.S. democratic procedures.”
Fake news about politics, and also about science and technology, is RT‘s trademark, as illustrated by its blatant disinformation attacks on the reporting of news by respected media outlets like the BBC. And according to the DNI’s’ report, RT became a platform to push anti-fracking disinformation in order to damage the U.S. shale industry. Genetic engineering in agriculture is a sector that holds intense interest for the Russians. Harkening back to the Lysenkoism catastrophe for agriculture in the Soviet Union, their expertise and current R&D in that area are virtually nil, and there is a ban on genetically engineered organisms from abroad entering the country, so they’ve adopted a strategy of trying to stymie its development elsewhere.
As Dr. Alex Berezow of the American Council on Science and Health pointed out: “RT has never been fond of GMOs (genetically modified organisms), which are largely the result of American innovation. A Russia-centered group concocted the bizarre FactorGMO scam, which billed itself at its 2014 launch as “the world’s largest international study on GMO safety,” as though that issue was still in doubt. The $25 million project has vanished into thin air. And RT has just released (May 23) a “documentary” film, “The Peril on Your Plate,” a propagandistic screed that presents yet again all the anti-genetic engineering memes and fake news. If the involvement of Russia and its notorious troll factories seems a stretch, consider the recent study by two Iowa State University researchers who looked at the source of articles containing the word “GMO” (genetically modified organism) and how genetic engineering was portrayed. They found that the Russia’s English-language propaganda outlets RT and Sputnik produced more articles containing “GMO” than five other major news organizations — Huffington Post, Fox News, CNN, Breitbart News and MSNBC — combined.
The two Russian outlets accounted for more than half of all the GMO-related articles among the seven sites (RT, 34%; Sputnik, 19%). “RT and Sputnik overwhelmingly portrayed genetic modification in a negative light,” the researchers wrote."

Glyphosate can cure cancer? Yes, some research ‘shows’ that — but what does it mean? And what does it say about Roundup doomsday claims?
"Now that three juries have said Bayer’s weed killer Roundup (glyphosate) causes cancer, many people believe there is clear evidence that the herbicide is dangerous. Organic industry-funded advocacy group U.S. Right to Know (USRTK) certainly wants consumers to believe that. The California-based nonprofit has played a key role in the three cases, providing evidence the plaintiffs’ lawyers have used to make their case. None of these claims stand up to scrutiny from independent scientists or oversight agencies, as GLP has reported extensively. But USRTK has employed a tactic (favored by political groups of all persuasions) in its opposition to glyphosate that is worth examining: Sifting through the peer-reviewed literature to find studies that support their argument, while dismissing contradictory research—widely known as “cherry picking.”
Selectively citing studies can lead to erroneous conclusions, which is why scientists criticize the practice and insist on evaluating all the available research, a standard known as “preponderance of evidence.” But if you want to show that glyphosate is dangerous, despite a mountain of contrary data, picking cherries is a useful approach.
To illustrate how easy it is to defend an unsubstantiated hypothesis, and why we should be skeptical of sensational claims about chemical harm or safety, let’s “demonstrate” that glyphosate might be a ‘cure’ for cancer by highlighting only the research that helps make the case. Over the past several years, a handful of studies published in peer-reviewed journals and conducted by researchers at reputable universities has in fact suggested that glyphosate possesses cancer-fighting properties. The first such study was published in 2013. Researchers exposed human cancer cells in-vitro, or outside their normal biological context, to glyphosate and AMPA (the degradation product produced when glyphosate is metabolized). The experiment showed both substances inhibited cancer cell growth and promoted apoptosis (cell suicide), but left healthy cells unharmed, “…. suggesting that they have [potential] to be developed into a new anticancer therapy,” the authors concluded.
The researchers published a followup study in 2015 and got a similar result. They exposed human prostate cancer cell lines to AMPA and a chemical called methoxyacetic acid (MAA), concluding that both chemicals could “…. be used as potential therapeutic drugs in the treatment of prostate cancer.”
Glyphosate testing in animals hints at therapeutic potential
In a 2016 study, the research team that found potentially therapeutic effects of glyphosate tested their thesis in animals. They exposed 25 mice to two different doses of AMPA. Compared to a control group of 14 mice, the experiment revealed that “….treatment significantly inhibited growth and metastasis of …. prostate tumors and prolonged the survival time of the mice.” Summarizing their findings, the authors wrote:
[T]hese results demonstrate that …. AMPA may be developed into a therapeutic agent for the treatment of prostate cancer.
Adding another interesting piece of data to the equation, consumer products company Procter & Gamble owns the patent on a pharmaceutical drug that contains glyphosate as an active ingredient and is designed to kill colon, breast and lung human tumor cells. According to the company, glyphosate in combination with a plant growth regulator called chloroprofam was “…. effective in killing tumor cells without significantly affecting healthy cells.” The unmarketed drug is potentially very interesting because it targeted cancer cells specifically and was also effective against viruses including HIV, herpes and influenza."

Thank you for this opportunity to let me prove you are an ignorant liar. The fact that glyphosate does not bio-accumulate in humans is a very good thing. We can't say that about most pesticides, especially organic pesticides. But the USDA, FDA & EPA all have strict limits on how much pesticide residue can be allowed in foods. They all test for it annually. Rather than making shit up and insulting our honest hard working farmers and crop scientists that feed you, why not check facts before you make a fool of yourself? Did you go to those three dot gov sites I listed to see if they do mandatory pesticide residue tests? NO!! If you had, you would learn of the national pesticide residue safety standards. It is 30 ppm for glyphosate. Safe levels are determined by international LD50 toxicity standards. We have to eat 640 pounds of GMO foods in one day to exceed the maximum safe amount for one day, and that calculated safe trace amount has a 100X safety factor for error. This means you actually have to eat 64,000 pounds of GMO foods in a single day to exhibit glyphosate residue symptoms at the lowest level!!!

Lying organic thug trolls will try to use fear mongering to convince you GMO sourced foods are not as safe when in fact they are far safer. What is not tested, ever, for safety?? Organic, heirloom, hybrid and new truck farm breeds. They go straight to store shelves with zero testing and YOU are the guinea pig. Look at what has happened because of this fact that never happened with GMO foods: "A year ago[2003] in New Zealand, there was an outbreak of food poisoning from a "killer zucchini" that hospitalized a number of people. Environmentalists jumped all over the story until it was determined that the culprit was "organic" zucchini. Plants are chemical factories that produce a multitude of toxins that protect them. An outbreak of aphid infestation had minimal impact on conventionally grown zucchini. The more vulnerable "organic" zucchini was genetically inferior because of inbreeding. They expressed dangerously high levels of the toxin curcubitan. Had this been a transgenic plant, we would be hearing about it ad nauseam, but being that it was "organic," it was quickly consigned to an Orwellian memory hole."

Organic farmers sent a $160,000 cash bribe to the IARC through a corrupt USRTK lawyer to get them to make the low cancer risk statement about glyphosate.

"The fatal flaw of organic agriculture is its low yields, which cause it to be wasteful of water and arable farmland. Plant pathologist Dr. Steve Savage analyzed the data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s 2014 Organic Survey, which reports various measures of productivity from most of the certified organic farms in the nation, and compared them to those at conventional farms, crop by crop and state by state. His findings are extraordinary: Of the 68 crops surveyed, there was a “yield gap” — poorer performance of organic farms — in 59. And many of those gaps, or shortfalls, were impressive: strawberries, 61 percent less than conventional; fresh tomatoes, 61 percent less; tangerines, 58 percent less; carrots, 49 percent less; cotton, 45 percent less; rice, 39 percent less; peanuts, 37 percent less, and so on.
In developing countries, where the baseline of crop yields is lower, we can expect to see even greater increases with the introduction of GE crops. Moreover, the availability of more-resilient crops – drought-, heat-, flood-, and insect-resistant – will dramatically increase food security there. What the poor desperately want and need is access to GE crops with desirable traits, as illustrated by the recent civil disobedience in India, with thousands of farmers illegally planting insect-resistant cotton and brinjal (eggplant)
Another benefit derives from herbicide-resistant GE crops, which makes possible more no-till farming, with consequently less runoff of chemicals and soil erosion and release of CO. GE crops have enabled farmers to apply far fewer agricultural chemicals, and where they are necessary, to shift to less toxic ones."

"Glyphosate and the gut bacteria is a topic that holds a magnetic fascination for many. They simply cannot seem to let go of the idea that glyphosate could be causing problems for the microbiome, despite the perspective of the minuscule size of the residue concentrations, and despite lack of signs of a connection to health problems and glyphosate exposure in all the epidemiological studies from last four decades.
Some studies do exist which suggest a connection, but so far they are only sketching hypothetical models, may often be of very poor quality, and their flaws are easy for scientists, and even laymen, to detect if given a careful look. One good overview of that kind presented on Skeptoid.
This does not stop people like Seneff, et al (see more on that in sections 3. in the previous post, 2.-3. Glyphosate and Health Effects A-Z) from theorising that glyphosate could cause a host of effects through unclear mechanisms indirectly via the gut microbiome. In her article in Forbes, Kevin Senapathy sums up the major stumbling point of these claims well: there is no evidence for glyphosate having a harmful effect on our gut bacteria (more on that also in the end of the post). She writes:
Targeting the shikimate metabolic pathway in weeds, glyphosate interferes with protein synthesis in plants, bacteria, fungi and other organisms, but not in animals. There is no evidence that glyphosate residues on food affect the shikimate pathways of bacteria in the human gut.
But the lack of evidence of harm does not necessarily give a layman the reassurance it may relay to a researcher. Let’s make it more tangible. To help us with the effort, firstly, the very thorough and detail-oriented skeptical activist Credible Hulk has kindly dug out the exact figures on allowed levels of pesticide residue on a number of different plants in his post and gone to even more detail in his blog piece, where he lays out the math: a 70 kg person in the US would have to eat 28 kg or 62 lbs of produce at the highest level of allowed residue every day in order to reach the limit set by Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as the still safe level for the consumer – 2 mg glyphosate per kg body weight per day. This allowed level already has a hundred-fold built-in safety margin: it is set hundred times lower than the level for no observed adverse effects (NOAEL) in the most sensitive lab animal species tested. It is physically not possible to eat enough of normal produce to reach that level. And what about gut bacteria?" See more at

Glyphosate can not bio-accumulate in or bodies or in soils. It passes through our kidneys as excess salt. That's why the activists who thought they had something when they found glyphosate residue in human urine actually screwed themselves - they proved it does not accumulate. It breaks down by microbial action in soils. There are many smart reasons for preferring it over any other herbicide and no legitimate science based reasons to oppose it. The organic foods lobby has worked relentlessly for 40 years to spread every conceivable lie about GMO crop science. They are losing.

Organic industry tyranny for 33 years and counting: "Although GMOs are regarded as safe as their conventional counterparts by every major food safety authority in the world, the organic industry spends nearly $3 billion a year through over 330 different organizations leading with fear and “information spin” as an industry to sell their products. They also sent a $160,000 cash bribe to the IARC to buy that claim of a low cancer risk from glyphosate, it paved the way for abuse of our legal system in false cancer lawsuits. By creating an unfounded fear that requires tighter regulations on GMO crops, they are hoping to force them out of the food supply, thereby creating a bigger market share to sell more products in their more than $65 billion wheelhouse. The unfortunate consequence of these [non-GMO] labels is that the food companies and lobbyists tend to create an unnecessary “us vs. them” divide. When food companies use fear against competitors to sell a product, farmers take it personally."

GMO 20-year safety endorsement: 280 science institutions, more than 3,000 studies
"Currently, there is a social and political controversy about the safety of foods produced from genetically modified (GM) crops. However, in the scientific community, there is no dispute or controversy regarding the safety of these crops. To date, more than 3,000 scientific studies [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8] have assessed the safety of these crops in terms of human health and environmental impact. These studies together with several reviews performed on a case-by-case from regulatory agencies around the world have enabled a solid and clear scientific consensus: GM crops have no more risk than those that have been developed by conventional breeding techniques.
In addition, there is also extensive literature that compiles the socioeconomic and environmental benefits that transgenic crops have reported in two decades of commercialization [9,10].
This document brings together the public statements of technical and scientific institutions that adhere to this consensus. I made an update based on this document from ChileBio that initially included 40 official documents representing about 190 institutions – the document from ChileBio was subsequently updated in 2017 with the institutions and statements attached here.
The update shows that 284 technical and scientific institutions recognize the safety of GM crops and their potential benefits. Interestingly a large part of these institutions are located in Europe, the continent that has put more obstacles to the commercialization of these crops. On the other hand, the countries with most organizations in favor of GM crops are United Kingdom (33), United States (25), Italy (23), Spain (16) and Germany (11).
In conclusion, 284 technical and scientific institutions recognize that GM crops are not riskier than those produced by conventional breeding, and/or the potential benefits of these crops."

Farmers in Paraguay see major yield increases with GMO corn, despite degraded soil
"10 years ago, a group of 14 peasant farmers in the San Juan Nepomuceno region of Caazapá took the challenge of ensuring their livelihoods through the use of biotechnology, according to a report from the Institute of Agricultural Biotechnology (Inbio).
Caazapá is a region with many riches, but in some areas its soils are very degraded. A group of producers is achieving success through work, permanent technical assistance, the introduction of sustainable practices and the correct use of biotechnology, with the support of the Institute of Agricultural Biotechnology (INBIO), reported Fabio Vega, extension specialist with the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (MAG).
“When we started, [farmer] Don Trifón Ruiz Díaz had a yield of tupi pytá corn of 800 kilograms per hectare, his cotton was around 680 kilograms per hectare, and chipá corn at 700 kilograms per hectare, in a highly degraded soil,” [Vega] recalled.
Díaz stressed that farmers were taught the correct use of biotechnology. “We learned about the varieties and their management, through which we were able to achieve better results …. [in 2019], when we had optimal weather conditions, we achieved significant yields,” said the producer.
On that occasion, [Díaz ] corn yielded 7,000 kilograms per hectare; cotton, 2,970 kilograms per hectare."

Myth: GMOs have a negative impact on the environment.
Fact
: GMOs allow farmers to preserve the land while doing more with fewer resources, and help us address today's most pressing environmental challenges.
"When determining the environmental impact of GMOs vs non-GMOs in agriculture, consider the ability for GMOs to preserve biodiversity. GM crops increase productivity on existing agricultural land and protect biodiversity by sparing lands not intensively cultivated. Through enhanced adoption of conservation tillage practices, the reduction of insecticide use, and the use of more environmentally benign herbicides that increase yields, GM agriculture has alleviated pressure to convert additional land into agricultural use.
GMOs can increase productivity in agriculture. According to PG Economics, from 1996 to 2017, GMO crops are estimated to have contributed to an additional global production of 213.47 million tons of soybeans, 404.91 million tons of corn, 27.47 million tons of cotton lint and 11.65 million tons of canola. GM crops have contributed to higher yields, e.g., 30% more in some farming areas, and can contribute to poverty reduction and food security in developing countries.
GMOs can reduce soil erosion. Herbicide tolerant (HT) crops enable more farmers to adopt conservation tillage because they help farmers to more effectively and efficiently control weeds at a lower cost. Florida farmer Lawson Mozley explains that with herbicide tolerant GM crops, weeds can be sprayed and remain in the field to protect the soil. Then the incoming crop is planted directly into the leftover organic matter without turning over the soil.
GMOs can help conserve water. Farmers utilize many tools to conserve water including drip irrigation systems. GMOs provide another tool that farmers can employ to help conserve water. HT crops, along with conservation tillage, aid in soil moisture retention, which can reduce the need to irrigate. GMOs can help reduce water use in another way – drought tolerance. This GM trait can help crops cope with stress and allow farmers to increase yields when periods of drought occur – without supplemental water from irrigation.
GMOs can help improve air quality. GMOs can reduce agriculturally-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Agricultural economist Graham Brookes reports: GMOs have helped farmers reduce their environmental footprint by allowing them to use fewer inputs and enabling a shift to reduced tillage. These practices have led to less time spent on a tractor, less fuel used and fewer emissions. As a result, GMOs have helped reduce CO2 emissions equivalent to removing nearly 16.7 million cars from the road for one year. They have also led to nearly 1.48 billion pounds of less pesticides being applied between 1996 and 2016.
GMOs can lead to fewer pesticide applications. A common misconception is that the adoption of GM crops have increased the use of pesticides when just the opposite is true. Overall GM crops, including crops with the “Bt” (Bacillus thuringiensis) trait for insect resistance, have contributed to an 8% decrease in pesticide applications. Not only is this beneficial to our environment, but also to the farmers who grow the crops."

A new study on the increase in the health of farmers since GMO crop science has become wide spread
Peer reviewed and published 27 September 2019
"GM crops, particularly Bt cotton, has resulted in significant reductions in pesticide poisoning cases due to reduced applications and reduced levels of insecticide exposure. Reductions in farmer pesticide poisonings have been quantified in China, India, Pakistan and South Africa. Often cases of pesticide poisoning are not formally reported to health centers and the results on pesticide poisoning may be underestimated due to the lack of reporting. In South Africa, farmers reduced pesticide applications from 11.2 per year to 3.8, with reported cases of pesticide poisoning declining from over 50 per year to less than 10 over the first four years of Bt cotton adoption (Bennet et al. 2003). One-third of non-Bt cotton farmers in China reported cases of pesticide poisoning, compared to 9% of Bt cotton producing farmers (Hossain et al. 2004). Assessing the health impacts in India, reveals a reduction in cases of pesticide poisoning of 2.4 – 9 million cases per year (Kouser and Qaim 2011). Cumulatively, since 2003, when Bt cotton was first commercialized in India, a minimum of 38 million fewer instances of pesticide poisoning have occurred, with an upper potential of 144 million. Farmers in Pakistan growing non-Bt cotton reported up to seven instances of pesticide poisoning in the growing season with 35% reporting no instances, versus Bt cotton farmers reporting up to six poisonings with 45% reporting none (Kouser and Qaim 2013). A medical assessment of 246 Chinese farmers, involving 35 health indicators, found that fungicides associated with the production of non-Bt cotton had linkages to damaged liver function, while the insecticides used in non-Bt cotton production may be associated with severe nerve damage (Zhang et al. 2016). The use of non-glyphosate tolerant crops was found to likely reduce renal function and decrease serum folic acid.
CHANGES IN FARMER SUICIDES
Mental health challenges and issues affect all walks of life and economic sectors, with agriculture being no different. Access to sufficient mental health resources can be problematic within the agriculture sector due to rural areas, remote locations and lack of access to mental health support systems. Unfortunately, suicide is a concern in agriculture. India has one of the highest suicide rates in the world and research has examined the relationship between farmer suicide and the adoption of GM cotton. Research examining the relationship between farm suicide and Bt cotton adoption revealed a plateauing of the suicide rate following the commercialization of Bt cotton (Gruère and Sengupta 2011). Farmer suicides were trending upward from 15,000 per year, peaking in 2004, the year after Bt cotton
was first commercialized in India. By 2007, the actual suicide rate was 25% below the extrapolated suicide rate. Cumulatively, the reduced rate of suicide associated with the adoption of Bt cotton represents the prevention of a minimum of 75,000 farmer suicides.
LOWERING CANCER INCIDENCES
The development of insect resistant crop varieties has begun to have a noticeable potential to improve human health through the reduction of cancer rates. Prior to the commercialization of Bt crops, maize in particular, insect damage to the harvested crop increased the potential for the development of harmful health effects. A study of 21 years of maize production quantified that Bt maize contained lower concentrations of mycotoxins (29%), fumonisins (31%) and thricotecens (37%) (Pellegrino et al. 2018). Mycotoxins are both toxic and carcinogenic to humans and animals and are considerably more concerning in developing economy food systems where access to food safety toxicity tests are less prevalent. Fumonisins are correlated to being the cause of higher rates of neural tube defects in high maize-based diets (Missmer et al. 2006). With food security challenges existing in many developing countries corn containing mycotoxins are consumed as part of the household diet due the lack of any other option.
NUTRITIONAL BENEFITS
GM crops have made significant contributions to address the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, in particular goals one (reducing poverty) and two (reducing hunger). While increased yields have contributed to higher household incomes, which reduces poverty, the increased yields have also enhanced household food security. Biofortified GM crops have been adopted, increasing micronutrient availability (Hefferon 2014). Nutritionally enhanced foods improve an individual’s nutrient intake, preventing and/or treating leading causes of death such as cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and hypertension. Improving the nutritional content of daily food consumption certainly has day to day effects, but of significant importance are the long term effects that extend for decades over the course of an individual’s lifetime. In many instances, improving macronutrients (proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, fiber) and micronutrients (vitamins, minerals, functional metabolites) has significant childhood health improvements, such as reducing blindness due to the lack of vitamin availability. Improved food nutrient content, especially the increase in mineral availability, contributes to improved immunity systems and reduces stunting. In many developing countries, plant-based nutrient intake accounts for one hundred per cent of an individual’s nutrient diet, further highlighting the importance of nutritionally enhanced crop derived foods. As the later in life benefits from improved childhood nutrition are better understood, the full value of nutritionally enhanced GM crops and foods, may not be realized for several decades." see the full paper at

Thank goodness FDA and EPA testing of foods no longer finds dangerous levels of Atrazine, paraquat, DDT, fludioxonil, metolaclor, acephate and diazinon. Now they find minute traces of the least toxic herbicide ever formulated, glyphosate, which is 43% less toxic than table salt, and Bt, so non-toxic that organic farmers rely on it heavily. WHAT A DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENT!!!! Anti-GMO idiots claim they want to go back to that nightmare list of much more toxic pesticides. Why???? I can't imagine.

You have much to learn about sources, fact checks and LD-50 data. It is the universal global LD-50 toxicity standard that determines relative toxicity. Some activist blogger on one of the 330 different activist organizations funded by the organic foods lobby does not change any peer reviewed facts. There is not one primary source for the comparisons, toxicity tables are assembled based on the topic. You can also do a search for one individual LD-50 rating for most chemicals. This is a good comparison chart:

A new study on the increase in the health of farmers since GMO crop science has become wide spread
Peer reviewed and published 27 September 2019
"GM crops, particularly Bt cotton, has resulted in significant reductions in pesticide poisoning cases due to reduced applications and reduced levels of insecticide exposure. Reductions in farmer pesticide poisonings have been quantified in China, India, Pakistan and South Africa. Often cases of pesticide poisoning are not formally reported to health centers and the results on pesticide poisoning may be underestimated due to the lack of reporting. In South Africa, farmers reduced pesticide applications from 11.2 per year to 3.8, with reported cases of pesticide poisoning declining from over 50 per year to less than 10 over the first four years of Bt cotton adoption (Bennet et al. 2003). One-third of non-Bt cotton farmers in China reported cases of pesticide poisoning, compared to 9% of Bt cotton producing farmers (Hossain et al. 2004). Assessing the health impacts in India, reveals a reduction in cases of pesticide poisoning of 2.4 – 9 million cases per year (Kouser and Qaim 2011). Cumulatively, since 2003, when Bt cotton was first commercialized in India, a minimum of 38 million fewer instances of pesticide poisoning have occurred, with an upper potential of 144 million. Farmers in Pakistan growing non-Bt cotton reported up to seven instances of pesticide poisoning in the growing season with 35% reporting no instances, versus Bt cotton farmers reporting up to six poisonings with 45% reporting none (Kouser and Qaim 2013).

"The shill gambit is a type of ad hominem or poisoning the well logical fallacy, wherein one party dismisses the other’s argument by proclaiming them to be on the payroll of some company.
Sometimes known as the Big Pharma Shill Gambit or the Monsanto Shill Gambit. The shill gambit is used fallaciously when the only “evidence” given of such a connection to a big company or government is the endorsement of the position of the government or company, without any other evidence–the implication is that they provide that endorsement only because they receive some sort of compensation from the company or other agency.On the other hand when such conflict of interest is both demonstrated by verifiable evidence and can be shown to interfere with a person’s judgement of the evidence, then it’s no longer a logical fallacy.
Example -
Clearly, anything the writer says about pharmaceuticals or GMOs can be dismissed because, even though I can’t prove it, they are obviously being paid by Monsanto and Big Pharma to spread the lies." This despite the fact that Monsanto shut down forever in 2017!!!

Normally, or hopefully, most people grow out of such childish taunts when they reach an adult age and start to mature.
.... Most people, but not anti-GMO morons.
Apparently that isn’t necessarily true for anti-GMO activists and, unfortunately, one interviewer used such a taunt against a respected scientist while he was attempting to promote Golden Rice. The now infamous YouTube video shows a short clip of an interview with Dr. Patrick Moore, where he states that glyphosate does not cause cancer and that you could drink a quart of it without it hurting you. The interviewer then mocks Dr. Moore by offering him a glass of glyphosate to drink. Realizing the interview is a sham, Dr. Moore ends the interview and walks off camera.
The video clip launched the attack by anti-GMO activists of Dr. Moore and anyone supporting genetic modification – if glyphosate is so safe, then why don’t you drink it? Naturally, activists also alleged that Dr. Moore was a paid Monsanto lobbyist.

All the incredulous comments are easy to explain - most of you were born into the largest longest most expensive propaganda campaign in all human history. You have never seen a world free of the lies from organic farmers.
Organic industry tyranny for 33 years and counting:
"Although GMOs are regarded as safe as their conventional counterparts by every major food safety authority in the world, the organic industry spends nearly $3 billion a year through over 330 different organizations leading with fear and “information spin” as an industry to sell their products. By creating an unfounded fear that requires tighter regulations on GMO crops, they are hoping to force them out of the food supply, thereby creating a bigger market share to sell more products in their more than $65 billion wheelhouse.
The unfortunate consequence of these [non-GMO] labels is that the food companies and lobbyists tend to create an unnecessary “us vs. them” divide. When food companies use fear against competitors to sell a product, farmers take it personally."
https://www.agdaily.com/insights/farm-babe-label-trends-end/
Now why do you suppose organic food is so expensive?? Imagine what 3 billion dollars could do for humanitarian goals - end a different disease forever every year.... End all hunger in at least one country...... Funding nasty propaganda? Really??

I took that more than 10 times in my life with no negative results and it saved me from sinus surgery or death by severe infection each time. Cipro is great but a bit over used. There are rare side effects from almost all widely used drugs. Even if that killed you the millions who ended their serious infections with cipro made your demise statistically justifiable for humanity. Maybe a few of them could have had major surgery instead to dig out that tooth or pocket of infection, that is drastic and to be avoided. Surgery has its own separate fatality rate.

Surfactants are added to the water when using herbicides even some Organic pesticides to make the pesticide wetter so it can be absorbed into the weed easier thus you can use less pesticide when using a surfactant. Roundup(Glyphosate) is used 3 to 4 months before harvest even before the plant blooms. Tell me how you would ingest it. You are more likely to inject the highly toxic pesticides Organic growers use. Whether washing dishes, cleansing your face or doing a load of laundry, surfactants make cleaners work better. Surfactants are compounds used in an array of cleaning products for their ability to lower the surface tension of water, in essence making the molecules slipperier, so they are less likely to stick to themselves and more likely to interact with oil and grease.
Beyond soaps and detergents, surfactants are used in lubricants, inks, anti-fogging liquids, HERBICIDES, adhesives, emulsifiers and fabric softeners. The human body even produces surfactants, known as pulmonary surfactants. The lungs produce surfactants at the cellular level to aid in the breathing process by helping keep airways open.

Monsanto was bought out two years ago. Glyphosate(Roundup) is the safest herbicide farmers have ever used even safer than many of the pesticides Organic growers use. Agent Orange was produced by three different companies for the United States Military at their specifications for use in the Vietnam War and has not been produced since 1969. Roundup does not cause cancer. You clearly have NO knowledge about this subject [USER 845].

No you weren't! We have used Glyphosate for 48 years because of it's pure safety and Glyphosate is used all over the world because of it's pure safety. There No vegetables that you can use Glyphosate on as a herbicide. Take your lies and misinformation somewhere else. Farmers know the pure safety of Glyphosate and that is why we use it. Why do you want farmers to go back to using more and more harmful pesticides when the one we use are eve safer than many of the pesticides organic growers use. Here is a study done with farmers like me who use Glyphosate.

Like I said Glyphosate is the safest herbicide farmers have ever used even safer than many of the pesticides organic growers use. Out of all the many many many many many herbicides that farmer could choose to use on his gmo technology crops can you name one that safer? Can you even name three of those herbicides or is Roundup(Glyphosate) the only word you know [USER 849 NAME]? There are many companies even foreign companies producing and selling Roundup(Glyphosate) Monsanto's patent ran out in 1999. Glyphosate is used all over the world because of it's pure safety.

OK assholes - for the last time - the pre-mixed chilled drink with pre-salted rim and lemon slice already prepared was the same thing. No different than 100,000 cooking show videos or bar tending videos where the finished dish or drink is already done for viewing before the camera rolls.

FALSE - the recipe was demonstrated by starting one deomonstation in front of the camera while the fully completed one was already done, chilled with salted rim and lemon wedge, under the bar, ready to go.

Here is how I win every GMO and glyphosate safety debate every time, with no exceptions - the mother of all citations:
GMO 20-year safety endorsement: 280 science institutions, more than 3,000 studies
"Currently, there is a social and political controversy about the safety of foods produced from genetically modified (GM) crops. However, in the scientific community, there is no dispute or controversy regarding the safety of these crops. To date, more than 3,000 scientific studies [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8] have assessed the safety of these crops in terms of human health and environmental impact. These studies together with several reviews performed on a case-by-case from regulatory agencies around the world have enabled a solid and clear scientific consensus: GM crops have no more risk than those that have been developed by conventional breeding techniques.
In addition, there is also extensive literature that compiles the socioeconomic and environmental benefits that transgenic crops have reported in two decades of commercialization [9,10].
This document brings together the public statements of technical and scientific institutions that adhere to this consensus. I made an update based on this document from ChileBio that initially included 40 official documents representing about 190 institutions – the document from ChileBio was subsequently updated in 2017 with the institutions and statements attached here.
The update shows that 284 technical and scientific institutions recognize the safety of GM crops and their potential benefits. Interestingly a large part of these institutions are located in Europe, the continent that has put more obstacles to the commercialization of these crops. On the other hand, the countries with most organizations in favor of GM crops are United Kingdom (33), United States (25), Italy (23), Spain (16) and Germany (11).
In conclusion, 284 technical and scientific institutions recognize that GM crops are not riskier than those produced by conventional breeding, and/or the potential benefits of these crops."

I can see that your knowledge on this subject is ZERO. A restricted use pesticide means you need to have a special pesticides license to be able to purchase the pesticide. DDT was labeled as a Restricted Use Pesticide so everybody knew it was not very safe and eventually it was banded.

Try to get an education on this subject before spewing out your ignorance.

The words are fear and ignorance with a good dose of brainwashing. They are slowly coming around. They are beginning to use Bt gmo technology since they banned the use of neonicotinoids. They import a tremendous amount of gmo technology grain now. Slowly but surely knowledge overcomes ignorance. As a farmer I appreciate the work you do defending Glyphosate. Sometimes dealing with some of this ignorance that you will find takes thick a skin.

Spaz is very misinformed. There is no authenticated explanation for the Brazilian illnesses and it was not cancer. In fact, the largest cancer/glyphosate study ever done was released in Nov 2017 for 54,000 farm workers who handled glyphosate for years. They had no higher cancer rate:
https://academic.oup.com/jnci/article/doi/10.1093/jnci/djx233/4590280

Your post is false Warrior. The IARC which a division of the World Health Organization which is what you are talking about said in March of 2015 that Glyphosate was probably a carcinogenic. They also said that beer, coffee, cell phones, aloe vera, pickled vegetables, fried chicken, and sunlight were also probably carcinogenic. They agreed that Roundup is the safest herbicides that farmers have ever used. In fact the LD 50 number which is the ratings used all the world to measure toxicity with the HIGHER the number the LOWER the toxicity. To show how low a toxicity Roundup has here are some examples. Nicotine 9 caffeine 192 Tylenol 338 Codeine 427 2-4-D 665 OFF for mosquitoes 1014 Table salt 3000 Baking Soda 4220 Roundup(Glyphosate) 5200.
Out of many many many herbicides that farmers can use on gmo crops ROUNDUP is by far the SAFEST of them ALL. Can you name one herbicide that is safer than ROUNDUP? Round up is even safer than many of the pesticides that Organic growers use.
http://weedcontrolfreaks.com/2014/06/salt-vinegar-and-glyphosate/
Roundup is applied at specific rate and no more just like all the other herbicides that Farmers use.

4th - Oh bullshit! It is harmless if ingested every day at field strength. The patent on Roundup expired in 2000, it is only sold as the more expensive option in garden stores, no farmer uses it. They buy the much cheaper Chinese made glyphosate. Do you even realize that field strength is 8 dry ounces dissolved in 500 gallons of water for a whole acre? Yes, 8 ounces into 500 gallons!

Monsato was bought out. There are many companies even foreign companies that produce and sell Glyphosate. Monsanto's patent on Glyphosate ran out in 1999. Why do you want farmers like me to go back to using more and more harmful herbicides when Glyphosate is safer than many of the pesticides Organic Growers use?

Says Aixa, who was born into the largest longest propaganda campaign in all history: Organic industry tyranny for 33 years and counting: "Although GMOs are regarded as safe as their conventional counterparts by every major food safety authority in the world, the organic industry spends nearly $3 billion a year through over 330 different organizations leading with fear and “information spin” as an industry to sell their products. By creating an unfounded fear that requires tighter regulations on GMO crops, they are hoping to force them out of the food supply, thereby creating a bigger market share to sell more products in their more than $65 billion wheelhouse.
The unfortunate consequence of these [non-GMO] labels is that the food companies and lobbyists tend to create an unnecessary “us vs. them” divide. When food companies use fear against competitors to sell a product, farmers take it personally."

Now why do you suppose organic food is so expensive?? Imagine what 3 billion dollars could do for humanitarian goals - end a different disease forever every year.... End all hunger in at least one country...... Funding nasty propaganda? Really??

You should never drink any pesticide even the toxic pesticides that Organic Growers use. As a life long farmer who has many many many many herbicides to choose from to use on my gmo crops, if I was going to have to choose one to drink it would be Roundup. Be glad that in your carelessness that you were using Roundup. With many of the other pesticides it would not have been good. Roundup is the only pesticide that is so safe that farmers can buy it with out having a pesticides license. Getting a pesticides license involves going to school and taking test. It is much harder than getting a CDL drivers license. I am glad you are okay but you need to pay attention on what you are doing and your surroundings when using any pesticide.

Sorry Cheryl but I do farm and there is nothing in your post that is correct. First there are many companies even foreign companies that produce and sell gmo technology seed. Farmers are free to purchase seed from whom they so choose. Farmers purchase seed they do not steel seed. They can not save patented seed and we have had patented seed for 47 years. All herbicides are use at precise rates put on with precision equipment. There are many companies even forgien companies that produce and sell Glyphosate (Roundup). Try to get an education on this subject before you start spewing out so many lies and misinformation. DDT was produced by 13 companies and was band in 1972. GMO technology is being use all over the world in many different things.

Monsanto no longer exists. Shut down over two years ago. Bayer assumes liability. Not one penny has been paid out in settlements. Science truth always wins in the end. "Doctors and medical professionals in California have stepped into the ongoing courtroom fight between Bayer/Monsanto and a former groundskeeper who blames the popular Roundup herbicide for his terminal cancer.
Last month, three state medical associations filed an amicus brief supporting Bayer’s appeal of a jury’s verdict in a civil suit that found the weedkiller to have been a factor in causing Dewayne Johnson’s non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Initially, the San Francisco Superior Court jury awarded Johnson $289 million, but that figure was later reduced by a judge to $78 million.
The verdict is under appeal by Bayer, which acquired Monsanto in mid 2018 and is facing an avalanche of similar lawsuits across the country. Now it finds itself with several new allies, following the move by the California Medical Association, California Dental Association and California Hospital Association."

Pod cast discussion about Shiva's fraud:
"In discussion of genetically engineered crops there is frequent reference to farmer suicides in India. Claims are made that Indian farmers build massive debt for cotton seeds, they become beholden to Monsanto for the money, and then kill themselves.
This story is repeated ad nauseam by Vandana Shiva and others that exploit the untimely deaths of farmers for political gain and to fuel anti-biotechnology sentiment.
Dr. Ronald Herring, a professor of government and international professor of agriculture and rural development at Cornell University, is a social scientist who has studied farmer suicides in India. On the podcast, Herring discusses the complexities of the reasons behind suicides and the role BT cotton has played in Indian agriculture. Guest host Kavin Senapathy interviews Herring and provides perspective of a first-generation Indian-American in the discussion."

You are lying. No organic farming is nearly as productive as GMO crop science. If you have depleted soils it is your fault for not rotating. The larger income far outweighs the larger cost to buy seed by a factor of many times. Many countries are making their own GMO seeds and giving them away free to farmers, like Bangladesh. I know you are aware of the wonderful performance of Bt brinjal, which Indian farmers are very envious of. Some of you are growing it illegally in India because it needs no pesticides to produce perfect blemish free fruit that sells well. That's why GMO is quickly increasing in use around the world.

After illegal seed planting in 2019, Indian farmers again demand access to GMO herbicide-tolerant cotton
Cotton growers in Maharashtra are once again demanding permission to sow seeds of herbicide tolerant (Ht) genetically modified (GM) cotton. Former minister of state for agriculture Sudabhau Khot, while speaking to The Indian Express, expressed support for this demand.
Last year in June, the district collectorate of Akola had lodged [complaints] against farmer organizations who had carried out a civil disobedience movement and taken up sowing of non-approved variants. India …. has permitted just one GM crop-BT cotton. This variant was permitted for commercial release in 2002 by the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC).
Weeding has become a major issue for cotton growers, both due to the cost as well as the labor involved. In Maharashtra, growers said they end up paying as much as Rs 10,000 per acre for the process. With agriculture labor increasingly becoming spare, farmers have been surreptitiously sowing Ht Bt Cotton, relying on seed smuggled from neighboring states."

India's neighbor/sister country Bangladesh has adopted GMO science in a big way. The government has developed 9 types of GMO eggplant for some of the 20 varieties favored across that densely populated country. More are on the way. This is documented in recent movies. Farmers can sell their seed or sell starters of the GMO Bt bringal as they please. Farmers stop spending 40% of their income on pesticides and are so glad for it! Bt bringal sells great in local markets.

"I hope a few science majors are in the crowd at Drake, so they can expose Shiva for what she is: a full-time environmental activist who spreads lies about agriculture in the developing world. Her deeply unscientific views, if enacted, would make it harder for farmers to feed themselves and their countries.
When she attacks GM crops as “poison” and complains about “deadness” in our fields, she sounds like someone who simply doesn’t know what farmers in developing countries really think and do.
As the daughter of a smallholder farmer in India, I agree with Shiva that seeds must remain in the hands of farmers.
This season, when it came time to choose cotton seeds, my father selected a genetically modified variety for one simple reason: GM cotton is a superior plant that has transformed our ability to earn a living.
Professional propagandists like Shiva have frightened many Indians into resisting GM crops."

GMO 20-year safety endorsement: 280 science institutions, more than 3,000 studies
"Currently, there is a social and political controversy about the safety of foods produced from genetically modified (GM) crops. However, in the scientific community, there is no dispute or controversy regarding the safety of these crops. To date, more than 3,000 scientific studies [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8] have assessed the safety of these crops in terms of human health and environmental impact. These studies together with several reviews performed on a case-by-case from regulatory agencies around the world have enabled a solid and clear scientific consensus: GM crops have no more risk than those that have been developed by conventional breeding techniques.
In addition, there is also extensive literature that compiles the socioeconomic and environmental benefits that transgenic crops have reported in two decades of commercialization [9,10].
This document brings together the public statements of technical and scientific institutions that adhere to this consensus. I made an update based on this document from ChileBio that initially included 40 official documents representing about 190 institutions – the document from ChileBio was subsequently updated in 2017 with the institutions and statements attached here.
The update shows that 284 technical and scientific institutions recognize the safety of GM crops and their potential benefits. Interestingly a large part of these institutions are located in Europe, the continent that has put more obstacles to the commercialization of these crops. On the other hand, the countries with most organizations in favor of GM crops are United Kingdom (33), United States (25), Italy (23), Spain (16) and Germany (11).
In conclusion, 284 technical and scientific institutions recognize that GM crops are not riskier than those produced by conventional breeding, and/or the potential benefits of these crops."

These studies together with several reviews performed on a case-by-case from regulatory agencies around the world have enabled a solid and clear scientific consensus: GM crops have no more risk than those that have been developed by conventional breeding techniques.
In addition, there is also extensive literature that compiles the socioeconomic and environmental benefits that transgenic crops have reported in two decades of commercialization [9,10].
This document brings together the public statements of technical and scientific institutions that adhere to this consensus. I made an update based on this document from ChileBio that initially included 40 official documents representing about 190 institutions – the document from ChileBio was subsequently updated in 2017 with the institutions and statements attached here.
The update shows that 284 technical and scientific institutions recognize the safety of GM crops and their potential benefits. Interestingly a large part of these institutions are located in Europe, the continent that has put more obstacles to the commercialization of these crops. On the other hand, the countries with most organizations in favor of GM crops are United Kingdom (33), United States (25), Italy (23), Spain (16) and Germany (11).
In conclusion, 284 technical and scientific institutions recognize that GM crops are not riskier than those produced by conventional breeding, and/or the potential benefits of these crops."

I just gave you the findings of 284 different global safety and health agencies and 3000 peer reviewed studies. You have to prove that each of them are being corrupted or bought off. Oxford?? The ENTIRE WORLD says you are an ignorant liar. Agencies from your own country say it is safe. You have offered no proof of any kind here. None. This is not a pissing contest, the one with the most verifiable proof wins. That is me.

Beliefs never enter into it. Only verifiable facts. Every legitimate journal has qualified fact checkers and researchers for verification of facts. Especially science journals. Unless you can PROVE a lie in any of my citations by providing conflicting unbiased information sources they all stand unchallenged. Peer reviewed studies have their own fact checking discipline by a group of impartial professionals. They also check for conflicts of interest in funding.

Hey readers - look at this guy losing the debate by failing to provide any proof of his claims. He is so science illiterate he does not know there is no such thing as 'artificial seeds' which would not be capable of sprouting. Only real seeds can grow. He also claims to understand our history of farming but has no clue that for 10,000 years farmers were constantly improving our seeds by genetic modification. Nothing has changed but improved methods for the same goal - better crops.

"In June 2014, Indian and international media reported that Navdanya and Vandana Shiva were named in a leaked, classified report by India's Intelligence Bureau (IB), which was prepared for the Indian Prime Minister's Office.[47]
The leaked IB report raises concerns over the foreign-funding of Indian NGOs whose campaigning activities, the report claims, are hampering India's growth and development. In its report, the IB said that Indian NGOs, including Navdanya, receive money from foreign donors under the 'charitable garb' of campaigning for human rights or women's equality, but instead use the money for nefarious purposes. "These foreign donors lead local NGOs to provide field reports which are used to build a record against India and serve as tools for the strategic foreign policy interests of the Western governments," the IB report states.[48]
Investigative journalist Michael Specter, in an article in The New Yorker on 25 August 2014 entitled "Seeds of Doubt",[10] raised concerns over a number of Shiva's claims regarding GMOs and some of her campaigning methods. He wrote: "Shiva's absolutism about G.M.O.s can lead her in strange directions. In 1999, ten thousand people were killed and millions were left homeless when a cyclone hit India's eastern coastal state of Orissa. When the U.S. government dispatched grain and soy to help feed the desperate victims, Shiva held a news conference in New Delhi and said that the donation was proof that "the United States has been using the Orissa victims as guinea pigs" for genetically-engineered products, although she made no mention about that those same products are approved and consumed in the United States. She also wrote to the international relief agency Oxfam to say that she hoped it wasn't planning to send genetically modified foods to feed the starving survivors."[10]
Cases of plagiarism have been pointed out against Vandana Shiva. Birendra Nayak has published on her plagiarism involving copying verbatim from a 1996 article in Voice Gopalpur in her 1998 book Stronger than Steel.[51] Several paragraphs of an article by S Faizi on the Plachimada/Coca-Cola issue published in The Statesman in 2015 were plagiarized by Vandana Shiva in an article she published a year later.[52]
Journalist Keith Kloor, in an article published in Discover on 23 October 2014 entitled "The Rich Allure of a Peasant Champion", revealed that Shiva charges US$40,000 per speaking lecture, plus a business-class air ticket from New Delhi. Kloor wrote: "She is often heralded as a tireless 'defender of the poor,' someone who has courageously taken her stand among the peasant farmers of India. Let it be noted, however, that this champion of the downtrodden doesn't exactly live a peasant's lifestyle."[53] Wikipedia - Shiva

Pod cast discussion about Shiva's fraud:
"In discussion of genetically engineered crops there is frequent reference to farmer suicides in India. Claims are made that Indian farmers build massive debt for cotton seeds, they become beholden to Monsanto for the money, and then kill themselves.
This story is repeated ad nauseam by Vandana Shiva and others that exploit the untimely deaths of farmers for political gain and to fuel anti-biotechnology sentiment.
Dr. Ronald Herring, a professor of government and international professor of agriculture and rural development at Cornell University, is a social scientist who has studied farmer suicides in India. On the podcast, Herring discusses the complexities of the reasons behind suicides and the role BT cotton has played in Indian agriculture. Guest host Kavin Senapathy interviews Herring and provides perspective of a first-generation Indian-American in the discussion."

GR2E has a humanitarian patent only. That protects it from corrupt governments. There is a rule that farmers will only be given it if they earn less than $10,000 USD a year. Most farmers who get it to grow are making under $1000 a year.

My comment stands -- this video is long obsolete as GR2E has been approved and is being planted this year in the Philippines.
You don't even know that all seed patents expire after 20 years!!
This generic seed then becomes a bargain priced gift to humanity. As of 2020, most GMO crops are grown outside the US and are not patented and are given away free.
I REPEAT - GOLDEN RICE IS NOT PATENTED TO PREVENT SEED SAVING AND SHARED USE
It only has a humanitarian patent to prevent corruption or profiteering by those who do not need it. Without seed patents, most of our best most productive seeds coveted by farmers would never have come into existence. GMO crop science is essential to slow human caused climate change.

What an odd assumption not based on any logic or facts. GR1 was never approved and it is not available. GR2E is not approved for sale in the USA because the FDA determined that US citizens do not eat enough rice to make it work for treating VAD. Asian kids eat an average of 25 times more rice in their diets so it is useful for malnourished Asians and other countries where rice is a staple of poor hungry people with limited diets. All the controversy over GR2E will vanish forever in a couple years when it becomes obvious to the world how cases of blindness and immune deficiency have ended in populations that needed it and started farming it. There will still be half a billion people with poor eyesight or blindness and other illnesses caused by the lack of vitamin A in their diets in the past. There are also plans for golden potatoes and cassava for populations who eat mostly root vegetables.

How about 13,000 peer reviewed studies? Will that suffice? Law suits advertised on late night TV by shyster lawyers have no basis and the supreme court has rejected claims based on no proof. There is no cancer risk - in fact the NHL these suits claim has steadily dropped in frequency in the same 30 years since we began using glyphosate, the safest and least toxic herbicide ever formulated. Scientists never share their personal views - everything is based on evidence from verified peer reviewed studies. Personal opinions, feelings and hunches have no place in the discussion of science topics.

No farmer has to buy any particular seeds. They asked for high performance seed and they got it. Farmers want to pay the premium for the best seed that guarantees them a larger profit. They know they are not allowed to replant patented seed but want it anyways. They also know what you do not - hybrid seeds never do as well when replanted, regardless of patent or not. They know that 20 year patents expire and there are already many expired seeds that offer high performance at a bargain price. This is a gift to humanity that is a benefit to all when patents expire. Without patents the huge investments in these seeds would not have happened.

Duke is right - hot peppers are a bug killer and yet billions of humans savor them. The only GMO pesticide is the Bt soil bacteria protein, used for 40 years now by organic farmers.

GR2E is the only gmo food to ever have full human safety and nutrition studies. There is some confusion over effectiveness because US kids don't eat enough rice each week to get all their Vit A but Asian kids eat 24 times as much rice.

You know nothing about Roundup Sharon. I have been a farmer all my life born and raised on the farm with all my income always coming from the farm. Roundup is produced by many companies including foreign companies. Monsanto's patent on Roundup ran out in 1999. You said Roundup controlled all weeds. That is false there are many weeds Roundup does not control and that is why Farmers always use another herbicide along with Roundup to control the weeds. Roundup is the safest herbicide out all the many ,many, many, many herbicides that Farmers like me can choose to use even safer than many of the pesticides that Organic Growers use. What herbicide do you think is safer than Roundup that you wish for Farmers like me to use?

Your post is totally false. YOU nothing about this subject Sharon. There many companies even foreign companies producing and selling Roundup. There are many many many many many herbicides produced by many many companies that I can Choose to use on GMO crops. How many of those herbicides can you name? Roundup is the safest of them all even safer than many of the pesticides Organic Growers use. Would like to talk about all the pesticides that Organic Growers can use? There are many many weeds that Roundup does not control. Have you ever heard of herbicide resistance which is a problem farmers like me have faced for years and years. Your anti gmo friends call them super weeds but they not super because we control them with other herbicides. Farmers do not receive direct subsides any more. They ended that in last farm bill in 2014 you must have been asleep at time. The lies and misinformation about gmo technology is usually told by those supporting the Organic industry trying to protect their huge huge hugely profitable industry so it does not surprise me that you are part of the organic industry. If you believe in free enterprise then why all the lies? There are many companies that produce and sell gmo seed Monsanto was no.2 in gmo seed sales. I said was because Monsanto has been bought out and longer exists. To prove you know nothing about this subject tell us the legal rate of Roundup that Farmers like me can use per acre in the United States? Please answer all my simple questions to show me knowledge on this subject. GMO technology is being used around the world even the medical field and it is time people like you stop with lies and misinformation.

I hope you are done here for you keep repeating the same old anti-gmo-er lies that have told and disproved over and over.

David please give Sharon a message from me for she has me blocked me. Tell her that this is from me for She is not a very secure person to have blocked me.
1. Farmers in Europe are starting to switch to gmo technology using Bt so they do not have to use Neonicotinoids above ground like we have in the rest of the world because they were hurting their bees. Europe has been slow to except gmo technology but that is beginning to change. With out gmo technology we would go back to using harmful insecticides of the past in this country.
2. The Seralin rat study was retracted and proven False and has never been reinstated. Seralini was anti gmo-er with an agenda and his rat study was proven false and never could meet peer review from the other scientist in the world.
3. Tell her I said as we say on farm She is a Chicken for Blocking Me.

Where have you been asleep at Sharon Congress passed a new labeling law last summer. If it does not say on the label non gmo it is not. To complicated for the poorly educated. Do you even know what crops are GMO and what crops are not? Man has been breeding plants in all different ways for thousands of years to help benefit mankind. 500 years ago a carrot was pure white. GMO technology is use in many things to better the world. Almost all Insulin used today by diabetics is GMO insulin. GMO rennet has been used for decades to make cheese. The cheese making enzyme breaks down proteins and separates them from whey. Golden Rice to benefit vitamin A-deficient children. & BT CORN AND COTTON. GMO proteins include blood- clotting factors to help Hemophiliacs, the hepatitis B vaccine, thyroid hormones, laundry detergent enzymes, and many synthetically produced amino acids used in nutritional supplements. There are many many many more benefits of GMO technologies. We all should give thanks to GOD for giving us the wisdom of GMO and stand up to those that tell lies about GOD's blessings trying to play GOD themselves trying to take away his blessings.

Your knowledge on this subject is ZERO Sharon. We have had patented seed since Congress passed the Plant Variety Protection Act in 1970 Protecting Plant Breeders with Patented Rights 25 years before we had GMO technology. Is Monsanto the only word you know. Monsanto has been bought out and is gone. There are many companies even foreign companies that produce and sell GMO seed. With gmo technology we use No insecticides with NON GMO seed we use more insecticide. You know nothing about this subject and prove it with every post. As the people have consumed more Organic food the rate of autism has increased. Organic Growers have used Bt for decades even injecting Bt into some foods. I am sure you have heard of bt corn. Bt corn contains naturally occurring Bacillus thuringiensis bacteria, a result of recombinant DNA techniques. that selectively kill caterpillar pest. Organic growers have for decades approved sprays containing Bt, a naturally occurring soil bacterium. Bt produces biotoxins lethal to moths,caterpillars and butterflies when ingested. Because it targets these insects' intestinal membranes(ABSENT in HUMANS and ANIMALS ), the EPA considers it benign to non- caterpillar species, including beneficial insects. When Organic growers spray bt they kill all moths,caterpillars, and butterflies but we do not do that with gmo corn because only corn bore and corn root worms attacks corn so they are the only insects affected. For 80 years farmers used dangerous dangerous pesticides to control theses insects but today we do not have to use them thanks to gmo. GMO;s are safer for my children, my Wife, our water, our farm, and our environment. WE and YOU should give thanks to almighty GOD for the wisdom of GMO.
